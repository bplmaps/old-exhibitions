                      During the 19th century, the United States expanded
                      dramatically westward. Immigrant settlers rapidly spread
                      across the continent and transformed it, often through
                      violent or deceptive means, from ancestral Native lands
                      and borderlands teeming with diverse communities to
                      landscapes that fueled the rise of industrialized cities.
                      Historical maps, images and related objects tell the story
                      of the sweeping changes made to the physical, cultural,
                      and political landscape. Moving beyond the mythologized
                      American frontier, this map exhibition explores the
                      complexity of factors that shaped our country over the
                      century.

                      <p>
                        The maps in this exhibition were created predominantly
                        by Euro-American cartographers, and published by
                        government agencies or commercial profit-seeking
                        companies. They promote Euro-American culture and
                        perpetuate certain interpretations of history.
                        Considering the inherent power dynamics helps us
                        understand that this was at the expense of other points
                        of view – especially of indigenous peoples, those that
                        were enslaved, and immigrant laborers, among many
                        others. It is important to bear in mind how these
                        documents reveal or conceal the ways people and
                        communities were dispossessed, exploited, and
                        annihilated. Unseen here but equally vital are stories
                        of heroic resilience, resistance, and cultural
                        preservation. <br /><br />The Leventhal Map &amp;
                        Education Center stands on land that was once a
                        water-based ecosystem that provided for the Massachusett
                        people who lived in the Greater Boston area. We
                        acknowledge these indigenous people, the devastating
                        effects of settler colonialism on their communities, and
                        their contemporary presence. <br />

                        VIEWPOINT: The perspective of Native populations in the
                        19th century cannot be properly told in maps, because
                        Native concepts about land are not two-dimensional, and
                        qualifying ownership with a paper document was an
                        imported European concept. During the rapid expansion of
                        the United States, the idea of Native homeland, a
                        multi-layered place giving life, sustenance, language,
                        spiritual communion, and kinship, would change to a
                        theory that land is preordained to be “improved” or
                        “developed” for the purpose of commodification. This was
                        a near universal change from Native land management
                        systems that had sustained populations for millennia.

                  This exhibition begins at the end of the 18th century, when
                  Euro-American settlers were exploring, surveying and rapidly
                  taking over lands west of the Appalachians that were inhabited
                  by Native peoples, as well as the French and Spanish. The
                  newcomers developed canals, roads, and railroads, in many
                  places appropriating Native trails, and created an integrated
                  transportation network. Exploiting land and mineral resources,
                  they initiated a capitalist economy based on agriculture,
                  mining, and industry. This part of the story concludes with
                  three significant events in the early 1860s that had major
                  impact on the transformation of the nation’s physical and
                  cultural landscape: the Civil War, the passing of the
                  Homestead Act, and the authorization of the first
                  transcontinental railroad.

                        witnesses to, the betrayals of justice that made the
                        violence of dispossession and extermination possible. We
                        can stand in witness, too, if we have the courage to
                        look closely and listen.

                  <i>Homesteads to Modern Cities</i> is the second part of this
                  two-part exhibition and resumes the story of
                  <i>America Transformed</i> in the early 1860s. Three
                  events—the enactment of the Homestead Act, the authorization
                  of the first transcontinental railroad, and the end of the
                  Civil War—set in motion a frenzy of changes in American life.
                  The northern and southern economies were rebuilt, settlement
                  and resource exploitation expanded in the West, and
                  urbanization and industrialization intensified in the
                  Northeast and Midwest. Completion of the first
                  transcontinental railroad finally linked the nation from coast
                  to coast. Settlers continued to build a capitalist economy, no
                  longer fueled by the labor of enslaved people but with
                  increased reliance upon immigrant labor. And by the end of the
                  nineteenth century, battles, treaties, and the establishment
                  of reservations had dramatically hemmed in the land and life
                  of Native nations. This exhibition concludes with the
                  establishment of the modern American city, using Chicago as a
                  case study.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
                <p>
                  The maps in this introduction provide a chronological overview
                  of how the boundaries of the United States changed during the
                  19th century. Originally comprised of 13 eastern states, the
                  United States expanded to include 48 states and territories
                  spanning the breadth of the continent. The familiar, tidy
                  story of progress and inevitability of westward expansion is
                  promoted in many historical American maps, including the
                  growing demarcation of national, state, and county boundaries
                  that etched U.S. colonial power and ideology into the
                  landscape. Some of the maps presented here speak to encounters
                  with Native people and offer insight into the complex and
                  varied ways that Native and Euro-American people interacted,
                  coexisted, and fought. Maps created by or copied from Native
                  authors conceptualize mobility and relationships between
                  people and places rather than precise measurements and
                  boundaries. A bitter and uncomfortable undercurrent is the
                  reality of the oppression and dispossession of millions of
                  Native people. <br /><br />

                  Published in 1866, this family atlas frontispiece promoted a
                  popular, mythic vision of the American West. Four Native
                  people point to features of white advancement: a homestead
                  stands in an area cleared of trees, a steamship huffs toward a
                  railroad bridge, and smoke rises from a distant factory.
                  Bucolic depictions like these implied indigenous people
                  docilely accepted their displacement. They also portrayed
                  Native people as dwelling in an untouched, natural
                  environment, despite the reality that they, too, impacted the
                  land. The image promoted the idea that white settlers tamed
                  the wilderness and advanced their civilization where it was
                  “missing.” <br /><br />

                  This large wall map details the United States at the onset of
                  the 19th century. The young nation’s western boundary is the
                  Mississippi River, based on the 1783 Paris Peace Treaty. In
                  addition to the original 13 states, three new ones appear:
                  Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee. As Euro-American settlers
                  moved across the Appalachian Mountains, they encountered
                  Native and French communities, including the Tsalagi
                  (Cherokee), Chikasha (Chickasaw), Chahta (Choctaw), and
                  Mvskoke (Creek) who inhabited expansive ancestral lands in the
                  southern portion of this trans-Appalachian region. An image of
                  Niagara Falls, which became part of the nation’s popular
                  iconography, adorns the cartouche. <br /><br />

                  Following the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France
                  in 1803, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the Corps of
                  Discovery to explore and map the new territory, develop trade
                  and diplomatic relations with tribal nations, and establish a
                  claim to the Pacific Northwest. Commanded by Meriwether Lewis
                  and William Clark, the Corps kept a daily record of geographic
                  observations and prepared numerous manuscript maps
                  incorporating information provided by Native people.
                  Particularly noteworthy are the names of tribal communities,
                  annotated in red ink. This was the federal government’s first
                  attempt to accurately map the presence of Native peoples (and
                  number of warriors) west of the Mississippi River. These lands
                  were claimed by the United States but firmly controlled by
                  Native peoples.<br /><br />

                  By 1831, the land east of the Mississippi had been divided
                  into 24 states and the Michigan territory. In addition,
                  American settlement and Native dispossession started to expand
                  west of the Mississippi with the addition of Louisiana,
                  Arkansas, and Missouri. The mapmakers also labeled the lands
                  occupied by the Tsalagi (Cherokee), Mvskoke (Creek), Chikasha
                  (Chickasaw), and Chahta (Choctaw) in large capital letters,
                  although just a year earlier, the federal government had
                  enacted the Indian Removal Act, which forced many tribes from
                  their ancestral homelands. The law paved the way for the Trail
                  of Tears, the name given to a series of forced relocations of
                  these Native nations.<br /><br />

                  Peter Fidler, cartographer and fur trader, recorded this map
                  in 1801 based on one provided by Ac ko mok ki, a Blackfoot
                  chief. West is at the top, and a double line represents the
                  Rocky Mountains. Below, the headwaters of the Missouri and
                  Saskatchewan River systems flow eastward down the map. Over 30
                  tribal nations in the upper Great Plains region are noted.
                  When the map was forwarded to London, the physical geography
                  was integrated into a printed map but the data pertaining to
                  the tribal nations was omitted to suggest that this region was

                  An Ioway chief named Non-Chi-Ning-Ga (“No Heart of Fear”)
                  prepared this schematic diagram of the Upper Mississippi and
                  Missouri River drainages for an 1837 treaty council in
                  Washington, DC. In an effort to prove the lands were theirs,
                  rather than Sac and Fox, the map records Ioway place names and
                  ancestral village sites. The tribe’s migration routes for two
                  centuries are marked in dotted lines, from Green Bay on Lake
                  Michigan (on the right) through Wisconsin to the Mississippi
                  River (central diagonal line) to the Missouri (vertical line
                  on left). Although the Sac and Fox did not dispute the history
                  expressed in this map, the U.S. government forced the Ioway to
                  relocate to reservations.<br /><br />

                  During the 1840s and early 1850s, the political geography of
                  the West changed dramatically. The nation annexed Texas,
                  established the 49th parallel as its northwestern boundary,
                  claimed the Oregon Territory, and won land from Mexico
                  following the Mexican-American War. By the time this map was
                  published in 1854, the United States included 31 states and
                  seven territories. Commercially published maps like this one
                  celebrated the nation’s expansion with small vignettes
                  dispersed throughout these newly acquired territories
                  depicting Native people, wildlife, and a wagon train. It also
                  suggests a unified nation, but a statistical table enumerating
                  free and enslaved population alludes to conflicts over whether
                  to extend slavery into the western territories and foreshadows
                  the impending Civil War.<br /><br />

                  While Colton’s map suggests a unified nation extending from
                  the Atlantic to the Pacific, this broadside published about
                  the same time boldly addresses the slavery issue. It
                  identifies free states in white, slave states in black, and
                  contested territories in gray. Issued during the 1856
                  presidential election, this stark graphic implicitly supports
                  the candidacy of Republican John C. Frémont, who opposed
                  slavery’s expansion. It also forcefully challenges the
                  so-called Three-Fifths Compromise which counted three out of
                  five slaves toward calculating southern political
                  representation, while denying those enslaved peoples any

                  Published shortly after the American Civil War, this map
                  depicts a reunited nation, but it also provides an inventory
                  of land and mineral resources. While the General Land Office,
                  the federal agency responsible for surveying and selling
                  public lands, produced this map as a yearly update of its
                  activities, it also promoted further expansion of western
                  settlement. The square grid pattern appearing in most states
                  west of the Appalachian Mountains indicates the extent of
                  public land or township surveys. Color coding identifies the
                  location of mineral resources. Reflecting the efforts to unify
                  the nation after the Civil War, this map marks the route of
                  the first transcontinental railroad.<br /><br />

                  This military map records the Nez Perce War in 1877, one of
                  the final campaigns of the U.S. Army against the tribal
                  nations of the Pacific Northwest. Gen. Oliver Otis Howard, a
                  Union Civil War leader, Commissioner of the Freedmen’s Bureau,
                  and a founder of Howard University, led U.S. troops. They
                  pursued several bands of Nimiipuu (Nez Perce) who refused to
                  surrender their ancestral lands and move to a smaller
                  reservation in Idaho. Threatened with forced removal, they
                  embarked on a northward trek to find sanctuary in Canada.
                  After a fighting retreat of 1,170 miles and 18 skirmishes and
                  battles, they surrendered just south of the Canadian
                  border.<br /><br />

                  While this information-packed map summarizes the nation’s
                  political geography and population growth after a century of
                  territorial expansion and native removals, it also documents a
                  new arena for empire building beyond the continent. Brightly
                  colored boundaries outline 48 states and organized
                  territories, as well as counties within each. Settlement in
                  the eastern half of the country was denser than the West,
                  which was characterized by much larger states and counties.
                  Graphs and tables demonstrate the growth of population from
                  3.9 million in 1790 to over 76 million in 1900. Marginal
                  insets depict Alaska and Hawaii (taken by a coordinated
                  overthrow of the Hawaiian Queen just a few year prior), as
                  well as “newly acquired territories” in the Caribbean and

                  By the 1890s, many Native tribes were displaced and forced to
                  live on reservations, comprising a fraction of their homeland,
                  on territory designated as the most undesirable for settlers
                  or in totally different environments than originally
                  inhabited. This map depicts the locations, sizes, and
                  boundaries of reservations, which were usually established by
                  treaties ratified by the U.S. Senate. In many cases Congress
                  did not ratify treaties signed in good faith by Native
                  peoples, and the agreed upon reservation boundaries were
                  renegotiated to the benefit of the government and the states.
                  In 1887, the Dawes Act (General Allotment Act) further reduced
                  the size of reservations by permitting the federal government
                  to assign land to individual Native families, rather than
                  tribes. The law fragmented reservations and opened more land
                  to non-Native settlers.<br /><br />

                  At the beginning of the 19th century, Americans had access to
                  globes, but they had to import them from Europe. James Wilson,
                  who became the first to produce globes in the United States,
                  made this globe in 1811. Rather than identifying the specific
                  region that was part of the United States, he labeled the
                  entire continent “America.” Wilson marked the boundaries of
                  the eastern states and Louisiana Purchase and noted the names
                  of several tribal nations. Since white cartographers had
                  extensively mapped the East, the globe features more detail in
                  that region than in the West.<br /><br />

                  The boundaries of the United States transformed during the
                  19th century. Mapmaker James Ives created this mechanical map
                  to help people, especially students, visualize these changes.
                  The base map labels the tribes that occupied different
                  regions, while the upper layers represent the territorial
                  growth of the United States. The mechanized pieces of this
                  cartographic puzzle include the colonies in 1776, the
                  Louisiana Purchase in 1803, and the Gadsden Purchase in 1853.
                  The map told a story of the seemingly inevitable process of
                  expansion and emphasized nation-building by treaties rather
                  than the violence of war.

                  To most people of European descent, the land west of the

                  deeply knowledgeable about the land on which they hunted,
                  traded, farmed, and developed communities. In the 1780s,
                  government officials initiated the settler-colonial process of
                  westward expansion. The maps and artifacts in this exhibition
                  illustrate how Congress set the principles for surveying and
                  selling public lands that had been gained through purchase,
                  treaty, trickery, warfare, and forced removal.

                  Surveyors standardized the practice of dividing land into
                  six-mile square townships providing the foundation for
                  settlement patterns in western states. Government surveys
                  noted the land claims of earlier French and Spanish
                  inhabitants but failed to recognize lands claimed by Native
                  tribes.

                  Meriwether Lewis and William Clark set out to inventory and
                  map the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase in the early 1800s.
                  Their trip paved the way for similar government-sponsored
                  expeditions and culminated in the 1850s with the Pacific
                  Railroad Surveys, which mapped potential routes for the first
                  transcontinental railroad. Each of these efforts brought back
                  cartographic and scientific data about the inhabitants,
                  landscape, natural resources, and wildlife. By the final third
                  of the century, many Americans became concerned about
                  conserving these natural resources and landscapes that were
                  rapidly disappearing through economic exploitation.

                  Frank Bond, a General Land Office surveyor, draftsman, and

                  that was atypical of other GLO publications. He compiled the

                  This large wall map integrated topographic and hydrographic
                  detail gained from various European and American explorations
                  of interior North America. It included data from expeditions
                  led by Alexander von Humboldt (northern Mexico), Alexander
                  MacKenzie (Canadian Great Plains), and George Vancouver
                  (Pacific northwest coast), as well as Meriwether Lewis,
                  William Clark, and Zebulon Pike, all of whom were commissioned
                  by President Thomas Jefferson to explore the newly acquired
                  Louisiana Territory. This accumulated knowledge demonstrated
                  that the western part of the continent was not dominated by a
                  single mountain range as was previously hypothesized, but by a
                  complex series of ranges that came to be known as the Rocky
                  Mountains. <br /><br />

                  Maj. Stephen H. Long’s scientific expedition (1819–1820)
                  continued the tradition of U.S. Army-sponsored exploration.
                  The expedition culminated in a published narrative with a map
                  that delineated Long’s route from St. Louis up the Missouri
                  and Platte Rivers to the Rocky Mountains. Information for the
                  eastern half of the map was borrowed from commercial sources,
                  while the western half corrected geographical errors made by
                  previous expeditions. However, Long incorrectly characterized
                  the High Plains as the “Great American Desert” (see
                  southwestern quarter of map). This misconception may have
                  deterred Euro-American settlement of the Great Plains during
                  the early and mid-19th century. <br /><br />

                  Rather than relying on Native knowledge, Long’s party included
                  scientists and artists for the first time. Although artist
                  Samuel Seymour drafted more than 150 sketches, the report
                  published only eight, which documented landscapes and
                  encounters with Native people. The final and most unique plate

                  five scientific expeditions. Charles Preuss, a German
                  immigrant and the expedition’s cartographer, prepared this map
                  depicting only the geographic information collected. Frémont’s
                  official reports, written with the assistance of his wife
                  Jessie (daughter of expansionist-minded Missouri senator
                  Thomas Hart Benton), gave “manifest destiny” a popular text.
                  Advocates of “manifest destiny” believed it was the nation’s
                  mission and preordained right to spread American institutions
                  and culture, thus justifying a policy of territorial
                  expansion. <br /><br />

                  Published a year after the annexation of Texas, at the
                  outbreak of the Mexican-American War, this map depicts the
                  northern region of Mexico (today part of the United States).
                  It reveals a cultural landscape with both Spanish and Native
                  settlements. Besides the Spanish settlements in southeastern
                  Texas, there were three other clusters in this northern region
                  – the upper Rio Grande (New Mexico), southern Arizona, and the
                  California coast. While some Spanish settlements had been
                  established more than a century earlier, Spanish culture was
                  imposed on numerous Native groups already living in the area
                  including the Pueblo, Numunu (Comanche), N’Dee (Apache),
                  Hopitushínumu (Hopi), and Diné (Navajo).

                        VIEWPOINT: This map offers a great example of the
                        fluidity of geography, as we can see how its meaning had
                        shifted and would shift again. Lost in the designs of
                        nation-states are the numerous indigenous geographies
                        (still visible in maps like this) that remain in place
                        and persist to this day.

                  U.S. officials agreed to adjudicate land grants, known as
                  private land claims, that had been made by French, British,
                  Spanish and Mexican governments to their settlers. The first
                  of these transactions were for early French settlements, such
                  as the village of Kaskaskia shown here, later named the
                  capital of the Territory of Illinois. On this map, the Common
                  Field is divided into long narrow lots, a common
                  characteristic of French settlements. These irregular surveys
                  were incorporated into the rectangular grid pattern.

                  Surveyors determined angles or direction in simple cadastral
                  or property surveys using a compass, like this one made in
                  Easton, Massachusetts. They measured distance with an
                  iron-link chain of 100 links or 66 feet, using a unit called a
                  pole or rod which equaled 16.5 feet. An example of surveyor’s
                  field notes documenting the “metes and bounds” of a survey

                  This educational poster illustrates the structure of General
                  Land Office township surveys. The top scene depicts surveyors
                  laying out a single section, measuring one mile by one mile
                  and containing 640 acres. The diagram labeled “Township Plat”
                  demonstrates the division of a township into 36 sections,
                  while the “Township Survey” diagram explains that townships
                  are identified in relation to a base line and meridian
                  (representing an X-Y axis). Each parcel of land has a unique
                  numerical identifier such as the 40-acre tract where the
                  surveyors stand could be identified as the SE 1/4 of the SE

                        VIEWPOINT: These divisions remind us of the harmful game
                        of wrongful land dispossession. For Native people, these
                        squares represent a systematic disruption of our
                        ancestral ways of life. This diagram reflects the
                        colonial concept of land ownership: packaged up in
                        little squares, as though one can compartmentalize a way
                        of life and sell it.

                  This small manuscript map served as a personal record of one
                  individual’s land holdings. It highlights the grid pattern
                  that was characteristic of public land surveys initiated by
                  the Land Ordinance of 1785. These townships were part of the
                  Ohio Company’s purchases in southeastern Ohio. This private
                  land company, composed of Boston investors, established
                  Marietta as the first Euro-American settlement in the
                  Northwest Territory. The map noted that William Dall owned
                  five parcels of land in four townships, totaling over 900
                  acres. <br /><br />

                  Ohio, the 17th state, was the first carved out of the
                  Northwest Territory. Survey grid patterns based on 5- and
                  6-mile square townships were first implemented here, in
                  addition to traditional irregular metes and bounds surveys in
                  the Virginia Military District. To administer surveying and
                  sales, over a dozen private land companies, military land
                  districts, and congressionally-authorized districts were
                  created. By 1832 when this large wall map was updated,
                  surveying had been completed. County boundaries and township
                  perimeters are marked. The cartouche promotes agriculture and
                  river transportation with a scene of a farm overlooking the
                  Ohio River. <br /><br />

                  Indiana Territory (“Land of Indians”) was similarly carved out
                  of the Northwest Territory in 1800. Published in 1817, a year
                  after Indiana’s statehood, this map indicates that officials
                  had divided the southern third of the state into counties and
                  townships. Numerous tribal nations, including the Myaamiaki
                  (Miami), Kiikaapoi (Kickapoo), Lenape (Delaware), Shawnee, and
                  Neshnabé (Potawatomi) inhabited the region. The map identifies
                  land cessions before 1817 with dashed lines. From the 1820s
                  through the 1840s these tribal communities were forcibly
                  relocated, most often to reservations in the Great Plains or
                  to Canada. <br /><br />

                  By the 1890s, the U.S. government seized over 1.5 billion
                  acres of Native land by way of treaty, coercion, military
                  force, and executive order. Tables in this compendium itemize
                  over 700 land cessions and treaties enacted between 1784 and
                  1894, while 67 maps delineate the boundaries of each
                  transaction. For example, the yellow and pink districts in
                  western Montana (numbered 373 and 374) refer to the 1855
                  Treaty of Hellgate, negotiated with the Séliš (Flathead),
                  Kootenai (Kootenay), and Q'Lispé (Upper Pend d’Orielles).
                  Through a contentious negotiation process mired in
                  mistranslation and differing expectations, the tribes ceded
                  their lands and became dissatisfied with enforcement of the
                  treaties. Hostilities broke out in 1858. <br />

                        VIEWPOINT: “Cede” is a very gentle term to describe a
                        deeply violent, forced, and uneasy process. As Native
                        groups suffered losses from epidemics and the
                        destruction of their food sources, they relinquished
                        their lands to the U.S. government, often as a final
                        resort. Native groups were forced to relocate from their
                        homelands, either by treaty or executive orders
                        promising them abundant resources in exchange for
                        territory – none of which were fully realized.

                  Isaac Stevens, leader of the Northern Pacific Railroad Survey
                  and Washington’s territorial governor, negotiated several
                  treaties during the 1850s to help justify the construction of
                  a northern railroad route and to entice Americans to move to
                  the Pacific Northwest. Two pencil sketches, prepared by
                  Gustavus Sohon, a German immigrant who served as an artist and
                  interpreter with Stevens, depict scenes from this period. In
                  1855, he produced this pencil drawing documenting Stevens’
                  negotiation with the Flathead Treaty Council. In 1858, he
                  accompanied the campaign against the Spokane, Schitsu'umsh
                  (Coeur d'Alene), and Palouse. His second drawing records the
                  defeat of U.S. Army troops by a combined force of several
                  Native groups. <br /><br />

                  The General Land Office produced manuscript survey plats for
                  each individual township. Their primary purpose was to outline
                  the boundaries of the six-mile square township and each of the
                  36 sections. Surveyors often noted natural and man-made
                  features that crossed or were near the surveyed lines. In this
                  Kansas example, the Kansas River and tributary streams
                  dominated the landscape. Green lines marked the boundary
                  between woodland and prairie, while existing roads,
                  farmsteads, and town sites were also mapped. One unusual
                  feature is seven 640-acre tracts, identified as Kansas
                  half-breed lands, which were allotted to individuals of mixed
                  Kaw (Kanza) and European ancestry. <br />

                        VIEWPOINT: Full breed lands did not exist because full
                        breeds were not considered human enough to be land
                        owners. Half breeds, or mixed race Natives were
                        considered to be partially human and able to own land,
                        while Natives with no European ancestry were less than
                        human, not worthy of land possession.

                  The Homestead and Pacific Railroad Acts, both passed in 1862,
                  dramatically changed the process for granting public lands.
                  The former allotted 160 acres to white settlers, as well as
                  freed men and women, who would improve land within five years
                  of selection. The latter authorized construction of the first
                  transcontinental railroad and established the principle of
                  giving alternating sections (640 acres) to railroad companies.
                  For example, this township was surveyed in the late 1850s, but
                  most of the land was not selected until the 1870s. Alternating
                  sections marked with “RR” were granted to a railroad company,
                  while those sections patented through the homesteading process
                  are indicated by an X. <br /><br />

                  The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the
                  Mexican-American War and ceded much of this southwestern
                  territory to the United States. The federal government agreed
                  to honor Spanish and Mexican land grants. Claimants in
                  California had to submit a documentary case file
                  (<i>expediente</i>) with a description and map (<i>diseño</i>)
                  of the tract. Displayed here is a diseño for more than 22,000
                  acres granted by the Mexican governor in 1841 and finally
                  approved by the U.S. government in 1867. <br /><br />

                  In California, Spanish settlements extended along the
                  California coast from San Diego to San Francisco. Over 800
                  private land claims required adjudication, reflecting a
                  variety of settlements identified as <i>presidios </i>(forts),
                  <i>pueblos </i>(towns), missions, and <i>ranchos</i>. The
                  latter were large land holdings that ranged from 4,000 to
                  40,000 acres and rarely had precise boundaries. Displayed here
                  is the final survey for Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas, originally
                  granted in 1838 to Maria Rita Valdez, a granddaughter of one
                  of the original settlers of Los Angeles. The grant was finally
                  surveyed and approved by the General Land Office in 1871,
                  although she sold the property in 1854.

                <p>
                  In the late eighteenth century, government explorers and
                  surveyors initiated the settler-colonial process of westward
                  expansion. In the 1780s, Congress passed the Northwest
                  Ordinance to establish the process for admitting new states.
                  The laws also outlined the principles for surveying and
                  selling public lands that the United States had gained through
                  purchase, trickery and obfuscation, warfare and other forms of
                  violence, forced removal, and treaty. Surveyors standardized
                  the practice of dividing land into six-mile square townships
                  that provided the foundation for settlement patterns in
                  western states. Government surveys noted the land claims of
                  earlier French and Spanish inhabitants and aimed to prove the
                  cession of lands occupied by Native tribes.

                  From 1803 to 1805, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark set out
                  to inventory and map the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase.
                  Their trip paved the way for similar expeditions and
                  culminated in the 1850s with the Pacific Railroad Surveys,
                  which mapped potential routes for the first Transcontinental
                  Railroad. Each of these efforts brought back cartographic and
                  scientific data about the inhabitants, landscape, natural
                  resources, and wildlife. By the final third of the century,
                  many Americans had become concerned about conserving these
                  natural resources and landscapes that were rapidly
                  disappearing through economic exploitation.

                  <b>For Kids</b><br />After the Civil War, large numbers of
                  Americans raced west in search of land and riches. Native
                  nations and parts of the natural world, like forests and
                  bison, suffered great losses as a result. Trees became lumber
                  and the search for fossil fuels and precious metals scarred
                  the land. At the same time, some Americans supported the idea
                  of National Parks to preserve the West’s most dramatic
                  landscapes. <br />

                  This colorful map documents the diminishing range of bison
                  during the 18th and 19th centuries. It accompanied an 1876
                  report prepared by Joel Allen, an American zoologist,
                  mammalogist and ornithologist at Harvard’s Museum of
                  Comparative Zoology. The map shows the distribution of bison
                  before 1800 (blue), 1825 (pink), 1850 (green), 1875 (yellow)
                  and afterwards (orange). To emphasize the influence of
                  migration and railroad construction on bison, the map also
                  delineates the routes of the Emigrant Trail, the Union Pacific
                  Railroad, and other railroads in Kansas and Colorado. <br />

                        Viewpoint: This map only shows trail and railroad
                        construction, but those were not the major reasons for
                        the demise of bison in the 19th century. Bison leather
                        was in high demand — it was used by the government to
                        make Army boots, and bison-leather belts powered the
                        machines that created the industrial revolution. The
                        leftover bones were shipped east by the new railroads in
                        massive amounts to be made into china. The demise of
                        bison led to forced land cessions by Native people as
                        many tribes lost their food supply and trusted the
                        treaties' false promises of food and supplies.

                  Surveyor’s instruments, rather than guns, were possibly the
                  most influential weapons used in the European conquest and
                  colonization of the American landscape. These tools were used
                  to establish administrative boundaries, delineate property
                  lines, lay out towns, determine transportation routes, and map
                  topography. This transit, which measures horizontal angles to

                  grant” college established under the terms of the 1862 Morrill
                  Act, which granted federal land to each state to establish
                  agricultural and scientific universities. Surveying was a
                  practical course for the civil engineers who would go on to
                  map the nation and build its infrastructure.<br /><br />

                  Reflecting growing concerns for the nation’s diminishing
                  natural resources as a result of individual ownership and
                  overconsumption during the first half of the 19th century,
                  this statistical map depicts forest density at the time of the
                  1870 census. The most extensive woodlands were in the East,
                  along the northern Pacific Coast, and in the northern Rocky
                  Mountains. Outside these forested areas were the grasslands of
                  the Great Plains and the semi-arid scrub lands of the
                  Southwest. Much of the East, which was originally very heavily
                  forested, had less than 20-35 percent of the acreage in
                  woodland after extensive deforestation.<br /><br />

                  This chromolithographic print of Yosemite Valley not only
                  provides an example of the remaining forests found in the
                  Rocky and Pacific Coast mountains, but it also captures the
                  drama of Western landscapes. Light shines onto a fertile
                  valley framed by sheer mountain cliffs accentuated by a
                  waterfall. Louis Prang, who immigrated to Boston from Prussia,
                  published such popular, colorful prints, which reinforced the
                  idea that the West was a largely uninhabited, wild, unique
                  landscape. <br /><br />

                  At the end of the Civil War, black troops enlisted into U.S.
                  forces, both former Union soldiers and new recruits. Known as
                  buffalo soldiers and consolidated into two cavalry and two
                  infantry regiments, these men fought against Native people and
                  the Mexican resistance as they provided security to settlers
                  moving westward. They also participated in the U.S. war
                  against Spain in Cuba and against Spain and the Filipino
                  resistance in the Philippines. Starting in 1899, soldiers of
                  the 9th Cavalry and 24th Infantry spent summers as the first
                  park rangers in two of the nation’s earliest national parks,
                  Yosemite and Sequoia.<br /><br />

                  The Indian Removal Act of 1830 allocated the eastern portion
                  of today’s Oklahoma for the Chahta (Choctaw), Chikasha
                  (Chickasaw), Mvskoke (Creek), Semvnole (Seminole), and Tsalagi
                  (Cherokee) and other eastern tribal nations. Following the
                  Civil War, the U.S. government assigned much of western
                  Oklahoma to tribes living on the Great Plains and further
                  west. When President Benjamin Harrison took office in 1889, he
                  signed a proclamation opening 1.9 million acres of "Indian
                  territory" to non-Natives for homesteading. This map depicts
                  the territory made available for settlement on April 22, 1889.
                  That day, over 50,000 people raced to claim the best lands,
                  including lots in the emerging towns of Guthrie and Oklahoma
                  City.<br /><br />

                  Two photographs illustrate Americans’ eagerness to participate
                  in this land rush. The first records the mass (and blur) of
                  people riding horses and driving wagons to stake their claims.
                  They quickly constructed towns and buildings to meet the terms
                  of the Homestead Act, which required settlers to erect
                  permanent dwellings. The other photograph illustrates the
                  growth of Guthrie, depicting Oklahoma Avenue after only three
                  weeks. Guthrie served as the local land office, and in 1890 it
                  was designated the territorial capital. Three years after
                  Oklahoma’s statehood in 1907, the government moved the capital
                  to Oklahoma City, a growing area at the juncture of major
                  railroads and home to a burgeoning meatpacking industry.<br /><br />

                  This map highlights the federal government’s impact on
                  transforming the American landscape by the end of the 19th
                  century. Designed primarily to show the extent of township
                  surveys, it uses a black grid pattern to represent lands that
                  had been surveyed and open to settlement, which included all
                  or most of the area in the public land states. The map shows
                  the extent of Indian reservations (solid grey), military
                  reservations (solid pink), and private land claims (pink cross
                  hatch or pink outline). The latter, which represent Spanish
                  land grants adjudicated during the 19th century, are most
                  prevalent in Florida, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and
                  California.

                      <p>
                        Viewpoint: As the U.S. government took over territory,
                        it introduced the English concept of "land ownership" to
                        lands that were never governed that way under Native
                        stewardship. U.S. land acquisition literally meant that
                        the land in question went from being perceived as
                        "sustaining life" to "sustaining means or income.” It
                        was a big change and it was harsh on Native people. This
                        dynamic overturned the power structure. Systematically
                        Native peoples' life ways and cultures came under
                        threat. Loss of access to land meant loss of true
                        freedom. This process of dispossession repeats itself
                        over and over, forcing Native peoples to begin adopting
                        a foreign way of life as a matter of survival.

                  The Homestead and Pacific Railroad Acts, both passed in 1862,
                  dramatically changed the process for granting public lands.
                  The former allotted 160 acres to white settlers, as well as
                  freed men and women, who would improve land within five years
                  of selection. The latter authorized construction of the first
                  transcontinental railroad and established the principle of
                  giving alternating sections (640 acres) to railroad companies.
                  For example, this township was surveyed in the late 1850s, but
                  most of the land was not selected until the 1870s. Alternating
                  sections marked with “RR” were granted to a railroad company,
                  while those sections patented through the homesteading process
                  are indicated by an X.<br /><br />

                  Following the post-Civil War Reconstruction period, African
                  Americans started to leave the South, migrating to northern
                  cities and Western states and territories. One destination was
                  Kansas, which was promoted in the 1870s through an organized
                  effort known as the Exodus. African American migrants were
                  told they would be moving to a “promised land,” and, as
                  depicted in this broadside, they were enticed with the
                  prospect of obtaining cheap land through the Homestead Act.
                  Unfortunately, by the 1870s, most of the best lands offering
                  good soil and climate had been claimed, and they were forced
                  to settle in more arid parts of the state. <br /><br />

                  1880. The town’s efforts to attract the railroad failed, and
                  its population and prosperity were declining by the time this
                  atlas was published. The portrait section, a common feature of
                  county atlases, provides evidence of the African American
                  settlement, since the very last page displays portraits of 12
                  African American families, six of which can be located on this
                  township map. Others were located in surrounding townships.<br /><br />

                  During the last half of the 19th century, Americans expressed
                  concern about the environmental costs of clearing forests,
                  mining, and flourishing industries. Early conservation
                  advocates sought to preserve the spectacular scenery as well
                  as the land, water, and forests. However, the driving mission
                  of the national parks movement—to preserve natural landscapes
                  untouched by human interference—involved the systemic
                  oppression and removal of Native people. In 1872, Congress
                  designated the headwaters of the Yellowstone River in
                  northwestern Wyoming as the first national park. The pursuit
                  of a pristine wilderness necessitated the forcible removal of
                  the Bannock and Shoshone people from Yellowstone. <br /><br />

                  In the mid-19th century, Americans began advocating for
                  landscape conservation out of fear that the West’s beauty
                  would be lost. In 1872, Congress designated Yellowstone as the
                  first national park. Louis Prang’s print of the Grand Canyon
                  of the Yellowstone River, based on a painting by artist Thomas
                  Moran, dramatizes light shining onto waterfalls carved into
                  mountains. Images like this reinforced the misconception that
                  the West was a largely uninhabited and untouched wild
                  environment.<br /><br />

                  The abundance of bison still living on the Great Plains at
                  mid-century is documented in this landscape view by John Mix
                  Stanley. It depicts a large herd dotting the North Dakota
                  landscape as far as the eye can see. Stanley, who served as
                  the lead artist for Isaac Stevens’ Northern Pacific Railroad
                  survey in 1853-1854, prepared a variety of views recording
                  scenery, Native peoples, and wildlife which were used for 55
                  illustrations in the final published report of the railroad

                  In contrast, George Catlin’s illustration provides a dramatic,
                  romanticized, Euro-American vision of the West—armed only with
                  spears and bows and arrows, Native people hunt bison on
                  horseback. This rendition evokes excitement of the high-speed
                  chase and the daring of these hunters before such powerful
                  animals. Catlin featured the print in his
                  <i>North American Indian Portfolio</i>. He focused less on
                  detailing an accurate landscape, and more on manufacturing
                  scenes that would appeal to readers.<br /><br />

                  In 1890, California's Yosemite Valley became the second
                  national park, although it had already been set aside as a
                  state preserve in 1864, following the violent expulsion of the
                  Ahwahnechee people. Both Yellowstone and Yosemite were mapped
                  as part of four Great Western Surveys that preceded the
                  establishment of the U.S. Geological Survey in 1879. Clarence
                  King, who headed the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth
                  Parallel, mapped Yosemite in 1870, while F. V. Hayden, who led
                  the Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories,
                  mapped Yellowstone in 1871. Both used the traditional method
                  of hachuring—drawing ink strokes along sloped land—to depict
                  the rugged terrain of these unusual landscapes.<br />

                  burnings, and building communities for millennia. As U.S.
                  government officials explored, mapped and inventoried the
                  lands west of the Appalachians, they advertised the fertility
                  of the soil and the presence of mineral resources. American
                  settlers cleared the forests to create farms and scarred the
                  earth to mine for resources, which eventually drove the
                  construction of industrial towns and cities.

                  Timber and coal fueled new factories in urban centers that
                  processed agricultural and mineral products into marketable
                  items. Under colonial and U.S. rule of law, this change was
                  known legally as “improving” the land. Wealth generated from
                  resource extraction and the labor of enslaved and free workers
                  enriched the prospects of a small but very rich upper class,
                  though new industrial jobs and small subsistence farms did
                  lift some free laborers and farmers out of poverty.

                        VIEWPOINT: When looking at these maps, it's important to
                        keep in mind that the idea of 'improving' land is an
                        English colonial concept. Native people worked the land
                        prior to American settlement. Disease-ravaged native
                        populations and vast farmlands quickly returned to
                        forest. The existing forests were managed systematically
                        by Native peoples in different ways and for different
                        reasons. The law said "improve", but what it meant
                        literally was doing something to make a profit. This was
                        usually done through farming, cutting down trees,
                        planting crops, raising cows, chickens and pigs, and
                        never moving. The concept that this behavior is an
                        "improvement" is purely a European perspective.

                  This statistical map addresses the importance of cotton
                  agriculture in the economy before the American Civil War. It
                  represents agricultural productivity rather than distribution
                  and density of cotton cultivation by mapping two variables:
                  productivity of cotton per enslaved laborer (blue, yellow, or
                  red) and ratio of enslaved people to freemen (solid versus
                  dashed horizontal lines). The map accompanied landscape
                  architect Frederick Law Olmsted’s published account of his
                  travels through the South during the 1850s. Hired by the “New
                  York Times” as a journalist to report his observations about
                  the region’s economy, he argued that chattel slavery was
                  inefficient for cotton production. <br /><br />

                  Pickaway County, located in central Ohio about 25 miles south
                  of Columbus, provides a good example of a rural Midwestern
                  county where the economy was based on diversified agriculture
                  during the first half of 19th century. The statistical tables
                  along the bottom margin of this land ownership map indicate
                  that the county had a population of 21,000 and farms were
                  valued at $6 million. Agricultural production included a
                  variety of livestock (horses, cows, oxen, sheep, and swine)
                  and crops (corn, wheat, rye, oats, hay, and potatoes). The map
                  also displays the boundaries of individual landholdings,
                  indicating that most were small farms containing several
                  hundred acres. <br /><br />

                  The economy of Schuylkill County, located in northeastern
                  Pennsylvania, focused on anthracite coal mining during the
                  19th century. This county map documents how that activity
                  dominated the landscape. Of the 37 marginal vignettes, 20
                  illustrate collieries – coal mines and connected buildings. An
                  additional ten depict local iron manufacturers, fueled by the
                  region’s coal. Also evident is the network of railroads and
                  canals that shipped these resources to New York City and
                  Philadelphia. The map identifies landowners’ names including
                  many coal companies, and also displays street plans and
                  directories for 23 towns, detailing retail activities and

                  The street map for Pottsville, the county seat and largest
                  town, accompanies a directory with 110 listings. Yuengling
                  brewery, which is the oldest brewery in the United States
                  still in operation today, appears in the list and is located
                  on the town map. This photograph, taken around 1855, is the
                  earliest known image of the brewery. David G. Jüngling, who
                  immigrated from Germany, founded the brewery in 1829. He
                  changed the spelling of his name to Yuengling so that
                  Americans could pronounce it. He anticipated that
                  locals—especially the many German immigrants who lived in the
                  region—would purchase his product. <br /><br />

                  Immediately prior to the discovery of gold in 1848, central
                  California was home to Native communities; Mexican missions,
                  <i>ranchos</i>, and <i>pueblos</i>; the small
                  <i>presidio</i>—fortified military settlement—of San
                  Francisco; and a few white American residents. Published two
                  years later, this map testifies to the frantic pace of
                  settlement during the California Gold Rush. By 1855, over
                  300,000 immigrants from the eastern United States, Europe,
                  Latin America, Australia, and China established mining camps,
                  towns, and roads. San Francisco grew rapidly. By the 1870s,
                  California’s Native population plummeted from an estimated
                  150,000 to 30,000. Thousands were forcibly removed from their
                  homelands, enslaved, or killed. Early legislation in
                  California made it lucrative to enslave Native peoples, or to
                  be paid for exterminating them. <br /><br />

                  This map, one of the first thematic maps of the United States
                  published by the General Land Office, provided an inventory of
                  the nation’s land and mineral resources. Besides showing the
                  extent of township surveys, it locates local land offices and
                  completed, uncompleted, and projected railroads. In addition,
                  it uses color coding to identify the locations of six mineral
                  resources – gold (yellow), silver (red), copper (green),
                  quicksilver (blue), tin (purple) and coal (gray) – primarily
                  covering extensive areas of the western states and
                  territories. Ignoring the presence of Native peoples in this
                  region, the map suggests that the minerals are readily
                  available for exploitation. <br /><br />

                  Lowell, Massachusetts, the first planned company mill town, is
                  recognized as the cradle of America’s Industrial Revolution.
                  In the 1820s, Boston financiers founded the town when they
                  constructed a textile factory on a canal bypassing the
                  Merrimack River’s Pawtucket Falls. By mid-century, Lowell was
                  the largest industrial complex in the United States. The
                  textile economy relied on cotton grown by enslaved people in
                  the South. The jobs attracted young women from rural New
                  England, and immigrants from French Canada, Germany, and
                  Ireland. The accompanying view, published in 1834, illustrates
                  how the mills dominated the city’s landscape when viewed from
                  the north side of the Merrimack River. <br /><br />

                  By the early 1840s, when this map was prepared, Lowell had
                  grown to a population of more than 20,000, making it the
                  state’s second largest city. The map details the footprint and
                  function of individual buildings and demonstrates how dominant
                  the textile industry was in the community. The map notes ten
                  named textile mills as well as an additional 19 mills and
                  factories. Mills were located near the river and canals, which
                  provided waterpower for the factories. The directory lists
                  company boarding houses, agents and superintendent houses, as
                  well as numerous churches, schools, and other public

                  The cultural and economic landscape of northwestern Georgia
                  underwent dramatic changes before the American Civil War. This
                  region formed part of the Tsalagi (Cherokee) homelands until

                  Plains from 1836 to 1839. Gold was discovered in 1828,
                  initiating one of the nation's first gold rushes and hastening
                  their expulsion. This map, prepared in 1831 by the Georgia
                  Surveyor General, promoted the richness of the area,
                  especially the gold mines and fertile soil coveted by
                  settlers. Besides locating a number of gold mines, the map
                  also displayed Tsalagi communities and roads. <br /><br />

                  Georgia’s gold rush ended by the early 1840s, but the
                  discovery of other mineral resources, including iron,
                  furthered the extensive exploitation of the landscape. During
                  the first half of the 19th century, iron furnaces, which
                  relied on charcoal, tended to be small rural operations
                  located near iron deposits. One example is the Etowah
                  Manufacturing and Mining Company located in northwestern
                  Georgia. The accompanying topographic map shows that the small
                  village encompassed the furnace, rolling mill, and workers’
                  housing and stores, while the company owned at least 10,000
                  acres of surrounding forest. This landscape was altered by
                  cutting down massive amounts of timber to produce charcoal.

                  While many Euro-Americans believed they were settlers in an
                  untouched wilderness, Native people had altered the landscape
                  by managing forests, growing crops, hunting, igniting seasonal
                  burnings, and building communities for millennia. Different
                  Native peoples developed relations with Spanish, French,
                  Dutch, and English colonial powers. In trading partnerships,
                  especially with the French and British, they often hunted
                  animals and finished pelts that reached Europe and Asia as
                  part of a global fur trade.

                  As U.S. government officials mapped and inventoried the lands
                  west of the Appalachians, they advertised the fertility of the
                  soil and the presence of mineral resources to American
                  settlers who in turn pursued a more intensive exploitation of
                  the landscape. They cleared the forests to create farms and
                  scarred the earth to mine for resources, which eventually
                  drove the construction of modern cities. Timber and coal
                  fueled new factories in urban centers that processed
                  agricultural and mineral products into marketable items. Under
                  colonial and U.S. legal systems, this change was known legally
                  as “improving” the land.

                  For several decades following the Civil War, Hartford,
                  Connecticut ranked as the richest city in the nation. As the
                  headquarters for numerous insurance companies, it was known as
                  the “insurance capital of the world.” The city also led the
                  Industrial Revolution as a large producer of guns, sewing
                  machines, and machine tools. One marginal inset illustrates
                  the Colt Arms Manufacturing Company, which produced guns
                  widely used during the Civil War and in later conflicts with
                  western tribal nations. This panoramic view from the east
                  captures the city’s economic diversity in the 1870s, when it
                  had reached a population of 40,000.<br /><br />

                  Richmond, Indiana, located on the original National Road near
                  the Indiana-Ohio boundary, provides an example of a midwestern
                  industrial town that was a center of government, commerce,
                  finance, and education. Oriented with east at the top, this
                  bird’s-eye view places the White Water River and the railroad
                  crossing in the foreground. The map’s directory lists 29
                  industrial enterprises. Many local factories manufactured farm
                  implements and processed agricultural produce. The largest
                  companies produced threshing machines, grain drillers, and
                  mowers, while smaller plants made crackers, baking powder, and
                  linseed oil. Others built non-agricultural goods, such as
                  pianos, caskets, boilers, and even map cases.<br /><br />

                  Modern fiction, movies, and television depict cattle drives as
                  an iconic image of the American West. In reality, they only
                  occurred from 1868 to 1886. Cowboys drove herds of 2,000 to
                  3,000 longhorn cattle from Texas ranches north through Indian
                  Territory to Kansas, as illustrated on this map. From Kansas
                  railheads, cattle were shipped east to stockyards and
                  slaughterhouses or west to mining towns and military posts.
                  The route provided sufficient grass, avoided tolls charged by
                  tribal nations, and veered around farms in eastern Kansas, but
                  the routes kept shifting westward to avoid expanding white
                  settlements. The success of the cattle industry hinged upon
                  the removal of Native people and wildlife.<br /><br />

                  During the late 19th century, engraved illustrations—like the
                  one seen here—became the first kinds of pictures that could be
                  produced cheaply and quickly. In this engraving, a man riding
                  a horse lassos a furious bull. Another man stands ready with a
                  brand to mark ownership, while cowboys guide groups of cattle
                  in the background. The engraving, and many others like it,
                  exalted the West as a place of excitement, where courageous
                  men could prove themselves by conquering animals and

                  The cowboys of popular culture have commonly been portrayed as
                  white Anglo men working on cattle drives in the West.
                  Historians estimate, however, that as many as one in three
                  cowboys were either Mexican or African American in the later
                  half of the 19th century. Many enslaved African Americans in
                  Texas were skilled in tending cattle from their work on
                  ranches. After the Civil War, these formerly enslaved men went
                  on to work as cowboys, one of the few jobs available to them.
                  While they faced discrimination from society at large, many
                  period sources suggest they experienced a degree of relative
                  equality within their cowboy crews.<br /><br />

                  A colorful poster portrays prosperous farmers to promote the
                  National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry. Founded
                  in 1867, the Grange, advocated for farmers’ political
                  interests, especially against powerful railroad companies and
                  provided an opportunity for farmers—men and women alike—to
                  socialize and learn about agricultural innovations. The
                  central illustration depicts a farmer, shovel in hand, in
                  front of his farm. Smaller images feature a Granger meeting, a
                  harvest dance, and men and women working on their farm.
                  According to this print, the Grangers helped farmers overcome
                  “ignorance” and “sloth” (as represented in the image in the
                  bottom middle) and improve their lives.<br /><br />

                  Agricultural production in the eastern United States is
                  represented by this plate from the statistical atlas
                  illustrating the 1870 census. There are four maps, each
                  showing the distribution and degree of cultivation of two
                  major crops. As the first national atlas, this prize-winning
                  volume was a landmark publication displaying an unprecedented
                  number of visual statistics and thematic maps. It was compiled
                  by Francis Amasa Walker, Superintendent of the ninth and tenth
                  censuses (taken in 1870 and 1880) and Commissioner of Indian
                  Affairs (1871-1872). Walker transformed the census, acquiring
                  and tabulating vast quantities of geographic information about
                  the rapidly expanding country. However, this furthered the
                  ability of the federal government to manage and control "the
                  Indian as an obstacle to the national progress," as Walker
                  described Native tribes in 1879.<br /><br />

                  In 1859, major deposits of silver known as the Comstock Lode
                  were discovered on the Nevada side of the Sierra Nevada
                  Mountains. Mining spurred the rapid growth of Virginia City,
                  which reached a population of 15,000 by 1863, prompting
                  Nevada’s statehood in 1864. This 1875 map delineates the
                  boundaries of the many mineral claims while the cross sections
                  indicate deep shafts to the silver deposits. Large debris
                  piles at each mine’s entrance left a distinctive scar on the
                  landscape.

                      <p>
                        VIEWPOINT: When the federal government codified place
                        names, they often relied on local input, including
                        derogatory terms which reflected cruel racial attitudes.
                        This practice was especially frequent in mining towns,
                        not because there were large numbers of African
                        Americans, but because the presence of a single one was
                        sufficiently conspicuous to suggest calling a place by a
                        racial epithet. In this map, the offensive term “Nigger
                        Ravine” appears towards the lower left. The name was
                        replaced by “Negro Ravine” by the Board on Geographic
                        Names in 1962. Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior
                        at the time, explained why the agency had chosen to
                        remove all instances of the word "Nigger" from federal

                  Scientific expeditions consisting of geologists and
                  cartographers were sent out by the federal government to
                  document the landforms of the western states. The goal was not
                  simply to add to geographic knowledge, but also to identify
                  sources of mineral deposits and promote the development of a
                  mining industry. This 1877 atlas of Colorado shows the bedrock
                  geology in colors corresponding with the age and type of rock,
                  while formations likely to yield silver and gold are
                  identified with dotted patterns. A silver boom in 1879 led to
                  the establishment of quick-build mining towns, while Denver,
                  shown here towards the right center of the map, grew from just
                  over 4,000 people to more than 100,000 between 1870 and 1890.
                  Today, many of Colorado’s mountainous landscapes that were
                  once valuable for mineral extraction are now valuable for a
                  different purpose: outdoor activities like skiing and
                  backpacking.<br /><br />

                  Many midwestern towns manufactured machinery to help farmers
                  increase their productivity. This colorful image advertises
                  the Lagonda Agricultural Works based in Springfield, Ohio. In
                  the center, three men demonstrate how to use one of the
                  machines. On the left and right, two men stand with manual
                  tools in their hand, yearning for this new technology. The
                  vignettes in the bottom corners showcase additional tools
                  available for purchase. It is no accident that the
                  advertisement portrays these farmers as uniformly white and
                  male. These characteristics embody physical ideals mirroring a
                  national identity that reinforced and benefited from
                  stereotypes of whiteness and western civilization.<br /><br />

                  This map, promoting the Rock Island, Frisco, and associated
                  rail lines, illustrates the variety and quantity of
                  agricultural commodities produced in the central third of the
                  country at the beginning of the 20th century. This region,
                  which included much of America’s richest agricultural lands,
                  encompassed 37 percent of the country’s total land area and 41
                  percent of its population. It produced over half of the crops
                  of corn, oats, wheat, cotton, rice, and sugar, and livestock
                  of cattle, swine, horses, and mules. Marginal inset maps and
                  pie diagrams demonstrate the geographic extent and percentages
                  of each agricultural product. <br /><br />

                  This map depicts the geography of the iron and steel industry
                  during the last half of the 19th century when coke from coal
                  was introduced into the manufacturing process. Consequently,
                  iron and steel factories moved closer to the coal sources,
                  since coal was bulkier and more expensive to transport than
                  iron ore. This map uses flow lines, a graphic statistical
                  device innovative for the time, with the width of the lines
                  representing the tonnage of iron coming from Michigan’s Upper
                  Peninsula and northeastern Minnesota and shipped to ports in
                  the lower Great Lakes, including Chicago, Toledo, Cleveland,

                  The Lake Superior region became the nation’s major supplier of
                  iron ore after its discovery in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula in
                  the 1840s, while reservations were established and Anishinaabe
                  (Ojibwe) lands were ceded. This view of Ishpeming, Michigan,
                  provides an example of an iron mining community and the
                  effects of mining operations on the surrounding landscape. The
                  shaded areas on the surrounding hills depict open-pit iron
                  mines. In the foreground, a train cuts across the landscape
                  toward one mine, while a network of railroad tracks service

                  By the second half of the 19th century, anthracite and
                  bituminous coal fueled the iron industry. As a result, iron
                  furnaces and steel mills were larger complexes located near
                  midwestern coalfields, with iron ore transported more cheaply
                  from the upper Great Lakes region. The Edgar Thomson Steel
                  Works, near Pittsburgh, exemplifies this trend. Constructed by
                  Andrew Carnegie in the 1870s and today owned by U.S. Steel, it
                  is one of the few steel manufacturers still in operation in
                  the United States. This site plan identifies individual
                  buildings while the photograph shows smoke billowing from the
                  chimney, then a symbol of a growing economy.<br /><br />

                  Pennsylvania was one of the first states where mineral
                  resources were exploited. Besides the anthracite coal fields
                  in the northeastern part of the state, there were other
                  resources like bituminous coal and petroleum. With the first
                  successful oil well, drilled in 1859 by Edwin Drake near
                  Titusville, Pennsylvania oil fields became the nation’s major
                  petroleum producer during the last half of the 19th century.
                  This photograph depicts a typical oil rig in the Titusville
                  area. By the early 20th century, newly opened fields in
                  northern Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma, and California surpassed
                  Pennsylvania’s oil production.<br /><br />

                  At the beginning of the 1800s, the West was not an
                  impenetrable, uncharted wilderness. Tribal nations had
                  developed extensive trading networks via a web of navigable
                  streams, rivers, lakes and overland trails. Many of the routes
                  followed by early explorers and fur traders traced
                  well-established trails forged by Native people. As the U.S.
                  government planned for expansion, locations for roads, canals
                  and railroads were pursued based on potential profits for
                  investors.

                  Because of poor road conditions, traveling by water was
                  initially the most efficient option. Travel became faster and
                  less costly over the course of the century. Landmarks in
                  transportation technology started with the introduction of the
                  steamboat, which made travel up the Mississippi and other
                  rivers possible. The completion of the Erie Canal in 1825
                  connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes, and the first
                  railroad made its inaugural trip in 1830.

                  Congress later made large land grants to help finance the
                  construction of transcontinental railroads. By the end of the
                  century, a complex network of railroads crisscrossed the
                  nation and made speedy and inexpensive land travel possible
                  for moving people and manufactured goods.<br /><br />

                  During the first half of the 19th century, it was not easy to
                  travel from the East to the West Coast. This map, published
                  after the discovery of gold in California, displays several
                  possibilities. One route was the lengthy ocean voyage from the
                  East Coast, around the southern tip of South America, to San
                  Francisco. Quicker alternatives, lasting one to three months,
                  combined ocean travel with a short land passage across Central
                  America. Travelers could also cross North America via the
                  Oregon Trail, which took four to six months. While this map
                  appears to emphasize ocean navigation, it also promoted a
                  proposed railroad route from Saint Louis to San Francisco.

                  In the 1840s and 1850s, the use of speedy clipper ships for
                  ocean navigation boomed. These ships proved vital for the
                  China trade and travel to California during the Gold Rush.
                  American clipper ships, characterized by three tall masts and
                  square rigging, were first built in Baltimore, but some of the
                  fastest were constructed in East Boston and Medford,
                  Massachusetts. These promotional cards provide evidence of the
                  role clipper ships played in mid-19th century transportation.
                  Such cards, which date from the 1850s and 1860s, advertised
                  the departure of individual ships, primarily from New York and
                  Boston to San Francisco. <br /><br />

                  While serving as Thomas Jefferson’s Secretary of the Treasury,
                  Albert Gallatin developed a comprehensive plan for the
                  construction of a national system of roads and canals to be
                  financed by the federal government. His report called for
                  canals and a national turnpike along the Atlantic seaboard, as
                  well as canals connecting the Atlantic rivers with the western
                  rivers, St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes. Although Congress
                  rejected the plan, it was visionary. Several proposals, such
                  as the National Road and the Erie Canal, were eventually
                  completed using a combination of federal, state, local or
                  private funds. <br /><br />

                  This map showing the meandering course of the Lower
                  Mississippi River and seven other maps of the Mississippi and
                  Ohio Rivers prepared by Andrew Ellicott highlight the
                  significance of the two rivers for travel in the interior part
                  of the United States. Ellicott, best known for surveying the
                  boundaries of the District of Columbia and completing the plan
                  for the new capital city in 1791–1792, was commissioned by
                  President George Washington to survey the nation’s
                  southwestern boundary with Spanish West Florida. Ellicott’s
                  observations from 1796–1800 were published in 1803, when
                  interest in the geography of the newly acquired Louisiana
                  Territory gained national attention. <br /><br />

                  This map, designed for travelers, compressed the Mississippi
                  River and its major tributaries—the Ohio, Illinois, and
                  Missouri—onto one compact sheet, providing a succinct guide to
                  towns and distances along the navigable portions of the
                  rivers. The Mississippi River and its tributaries provided
                  transportation arteries for exploration, commerce, and travel.
                  Starting in the early 19th century, steamboats dominated
                  transportation on these navigable rivers. Canals, also
                  introduced in the early 19th century, improved transportation,
                  but they required significant investments into infrastructure.
                  Steamboats, on the other hand, could travel on existing
                  waterways and, unlike boats that relied on sails, against the
                  current. <br />

                  The Appalachian Mountains presented an obstacle for traffic
                  flow from the Atlantic seaboard to the Midwest. After
                  considering various projects to cross this barrier, the New
                  York state government built the Erie Canal. Constructed from
                  1817 to 1825, the canal extended 363 miles connecting Albany
                  (on the Hudson River) with Buffalo (on Lake Erie). Taking
                  advantage of a natural break in the mountain chain, the route
                  climbed an elevation of 568 feet, using 83 locks and 18
                  aqueducts, as depicted on this 1821 plan. Its successful
                  completion and profitable operation ushered in an era of canal
                  building in the United States. <br />

                  This engraving, originally published in 1825, documents the
                  jubilant celebration of the Erie Canal’s completion held in
                  New York City’s Harbor. A fleet of boats assembled for the
                  occasion. Their tall masts display their colors as well as the
                  American flag. New York City, already the nation’s largest
                  city, benefited the most from the canal’s success. Between the
                  canal’s completion in 1825 and 1850, the city’s population
                  grew from 180,000 to 700,000. This rapid growth resulted from
                  increased commerce, via the Hudson River and Erie Canal, with
                  a hinterland that encompassed the Great Lakes and Mississippi
                  River Valley. <br /><br />

                  For New Yorkers along the route, the Erie Canal made travel
                  much faster and cheaper than travel by wagon on bumpy roads.
                  Merchants took advantage of this new form of transportation,
                  and the price of shipping goods dropped 90 percent. Examples
                  of three cargo tickets dated 1831 certify that a trader paid
                  the tolls to ship cargo via the canal. These receipts, which
                  list the cargo, its origin, and its destination, reveal
                  various types of freight—wheat, flour, whiskey, and furniture.
                  Despite the canal’s success, within decades steamships and
                  railroads became more popular for fast and efficient
                  travel.<br />

                  For 18th-century French, British, and American colonists, the
                  Hudson River was strategically important as part of the
                  corridor linking New York City and Montreal. With the
                  completion of the Erie Canal, it became part of the route
                  connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. This
                  topographic strip map, published in 1848, emphasizes the
                  navigable portion of the river and marks the route of the new
                  Hudson River Railroad, chartered in 1846. The map identified
                  major towns and villages, some of which were becoming
                  industrial centers that manufactured goods for markets in New
                  York City or for export. <br /><br />

                  In 1795, Americans constructed a turnpike between Philadelphia
                  and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Instead of the state funding the
                  road, individuals purchased stock to finance the project. The
                  turnpike was the nation’s first long-distance road. It had a
                  stone surface that made travel by wagons and horses easier
                  during rainy weather. The engraving at the top of this
                  certificate depicts a Conestoga wagon approaching an opened
                  gate that signified the beginning of the toll road.

                  Small, pocket-size guide books provided maps and directions
                  for late 18th-century travelers attempting to negotiate the
                  various unmarked routes connecting cities and towns along the
                  eastern seaboard. This example, published in 1789, was the
                  first to include maps. It depicted routes from New York City
                  north to Albany, and south through Philadelphia to
                  Williamsburg, Virginia. Displayed here are the title page and
                  two pages showing about 24 miles of the road south of
                  Philadelphia toward Annapolis, Maryland. These strip maps
                  identified the primary route and intersections, bridges,
                  churches, taverns, mills, and blacksmith shops along the
                  route, much like today's GPS systems. <br /><br />

                  In the 1790s, transportation within the new nation was slow
                  and cumbersome. This early postal route map depicts navigable
                  rivers and existing roads. National postal service had existed
                  since the Revolutionary War, but Congress did not institute a
                  formal Post Office Department to designate post offices and
                  postal roads until 1792. Abraham Bradley, an assistant
                  postmaster general for 30 years, prepared the first post route
                  map in 1796. He revised it numerous times, though the earliest
                  versions included an innovative schedule chart that listed the
                  estimated time for postal delivery from Maine to Georgia. At
                  that time, it took 46 days to travel the entire route.

                  The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was the nation’s first
                  steam-operated railway. Baltimore merchants conceived this
                  project as a means of competing with New York’s successful
                  Erie Canal. They wanted to profit from the lucrative trade
                  west of the Appalachians. Construction began in 1828, and the
                  first section of the railroad opened in 1830. The train ran 13
                  miles from Baltimore to Ellicott’s Mills (present-day Ellicott
                  City), Maryland. This print depicts a short train traveling
                  the tracks on the far side of the river. Steam puffs out of
                  the engine into the sky, as two travelers on horses watch the
                  train pass. <br /><br />

                  Though we know the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad became
                  successful, Americans at that time did not. Investors who
                  financially backed the railroad’s construction received stock
                  certificates like this one purchased by Richard Emory. The
                  certificate features three illustrations at the top. Two
                  female allegorical figures flank a central image of the new
                  track, suggesting its potential for carrying supplies and
                  people. The success of this endeavor proved that the new mode
                  of transportation could be constructed elsewhere. <br /><br />

                  By mid-19th century, with increased oceanic traffic between
                  the East and West Coasts based on the China trade and
                  discovery of gold in California, many Americans wanted to
                  extend the nation’s rail network west of the Mississippi River
                  by constructing a transcontinental route. In 1853, Congress
                  authorized the War Department to conduct reconnaissance
                  surveys in order to determine the best route for a
                  transcontinental railroad. Because of growing sectional
                  rivalries between the North and South in extending chattel
                  slavery into the western territories, there were four
                  east-west Pacific Railroad Surveys, as indicated on this
                  schematic map. <br /><br />

                  The results of the Pacific Railroad Surveys were documented in
                  numerous topographic maps and 12 volumes of reports describing
                  the geography, flora and fauna, and Native peoples. These
                  volumes included numerous illustrations depicting Native
                  people and natural landscapes, such as these two views
                  prepared by John Mix Stanley while serving with the Northern
                  Pacific Railroad Survey party. One records a meeting on the
                  northern Great Plains with the Assiniboine, whose chief
                  expressed grave concerns that the coming railroad would
                  greatly affect their way of life, and the other depicts
                  Montana’s Milk River Valley with a pair of antelope in the

                  This map displays the nation's growing transportation and
                  communication network on the eve of the Civil War. The legend
                  identifies rail lines that were in operation, in progress, and
                  proposed, along with telegraph and coastal steamship lines.
                  Railroads were densest in the North, extending from New
                  England through the Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states. In the
                  South, the network was less dense, with shorter lines running
                  from interior locations to coastal ports. This map was
                  overprinted around 1861 to show the first southern states to
                  secede from the Union with an early version of the Confederate
                  flag flying over Montgomery, Alabama, the first capital of the
                  Confederacy.

                  At the beginning of the 19th century, the West was not an
                  impenetrable, uncharted wilderness. Tribal nations had
                  developed extensive trading networks via a web of navigable
                  streams, rivers, lakes and overland trails. Many of the routes
                  followed by early explorers and fur traders, such as the Santa
                  Fe and Oregon Trails, followed well-established trails forged
                  by Native people.

                  Because of poor road conditions, traveling by water was
                  initially the most efficient option. Travel became faster and
                  less costly over the course of the century. Landmarks in
                  transportation technology started with the introduction of the
                  steamboat, which made travel up the Mississippi and other
                  rivers possible. The completion of the Erie Canal in 1825
                  connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes, and the first
                  railroad made its inaugural trip in 1830.

                  Congress later made large land grants to help finance the
                  construction of transcontinental railroads. By the end of the
                  century, a complex network of railroads crisscrossed the
                  nation and made speedy and inexpensive land travel possible
                  for moving people and manufactured goods.

                  <b>For Kids<br /></b>The United States planned the locations

                  make money for the government, the transportation companies
                  and for towns along the routes. The decision about where to

                  Railroad infrastructure expanded from 31,000 miles in 1860 to
                  130,000 miles by the 1890s. To subsidize construction, the
                  U.S. government gave over 140 million acres of public land to
                  railroad companies, oftentimes dispossessing Native nations in
                  the process. This land was used to locate tracks or sold to
                  raise capital for the railroad company. Companies argued that
                  they deserved government support because they were creating a
                  public good. Opponents, like those who printed this poster,
                  argued that railroads should return this land to the
                  government rather than profit from its sale. This 1884 poster
                  declares that these railroad land grants would create 871,268

                  After the Civil War, there was strong interest in constructing
                  a new transcontinental route across the southwestern United
                  States. In 1871, Congress chartered the Texas and Pacific
                  Railway to build a railroad from eastern Texas to San Diego.
                  This map highlights the proposed route to promote land sales
                  and encourage emigration to Texas’ rich agricultural lands.
                  When this map was published, the rail line had been completed
                  to Dallas and Fort Worth. Three central illustrations depict
                  the growth of this area. The railroad as proposed never
                  reached San Diego but eventually connected with the Southern
                  Pacific Railroad just east of El Paso. <br /><br />

                  This map marks the route of the first transcontinental
                  railroad, constructed between 1863 and 1869. Two railroad
                  companies constructed the route. The Central Pacific worked
                  eastward from Sacramento, and the Union Pacific worked
                  westward from Omaha. Congress approved land grants and 30-year
                  bonds to finance construction. These companies employed
                  thousands of immigrant laborers, including Irish, German, and
                  Chinese immigrants to lay the tracks. While the map blatantly
                  promotes land sales, border illustrations highlight important
                  landmarks along the route, including the Mormon temple and
                  tabernacle in Salt Lake City. <br /><br />

                  On May 10, 1869, representatives of the Union Pacific and
                  Central Pacific Railroad Companies gathered to celebrate the
                  completion of the first transcontinental railroad. Andrew J.
                  Russell, who photographed the railroad’s construction,
                  captured the ceremony to drive the final golden spike, but it
                  portrays only white men, belying the fact that thousands of
                  immigrant workers made this moment possible.

                  By 1867, roughly 90 percent of the Central Pacific’s workers
                  were Chinese immigrants. Despite doing the most dangerous work
                  such as blasting, Chinese workers received less pay than white
                  counterparts and their contributions were often
                  underappreciated. In the second photograph, three of the eight
                  Chinese workers who laid the final railroad tie sit on a
                  parade float during the 1919 50th anniversary celebration in

                  Many people from China and other Asian nations came to Hawaii
                  and the West during the last half of the 19th century. Large
                  numbers immigrated during the 1849 California Gold Rush,
                  reaching 25,000 by 1852. During subsequent decades, they
                  played an important role, though often exploited, as laborers
                  for the transcontinental railroads. Prompted by racial
                  discrimination and fears that Chinese laborers threatened
                  American society, the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act halted
                  immigration from China. Many remaining immigrants created
                  their own culturally distinct enclaves known as “Chinatowns.”
                  Displayed here is a map of San Francisco’s Chinatown, the
                  oldest and one of the largest Chinatowns in North America.

                        oldest continuously inhabited ethnic communities in
                        America, but this 1929 map gives no indication of that
                        longevity nor of its central importance to American
                        imperial history. As much as Sinophobes repeatedly tried
                        for decades, they could not remove Chinese from the
                        site. It was a location in continual flux; it was a
                        permanent residence for some, but for many it was
                        temporary, a way station between disembarkation and
                        destinations elsewhere. So it was for thousands of
                        railroad workers who came to help complete the first
                        transcontinental route in the 1860s. Even building
                        designations were incomplete and misleading: stores
                        could house gambling dens in the back room; laundries
                        could be living quarters; brothels could be homes for
                        families and children. “Chinatown” is a simple name but
                        an extraordinarily rich and complex site of human
                        experiences.

                  At the end of the century, the nation’s railroad network grew
                  rapidly, resulting in a complex web that linked the eastern
                  and western parts of the country. This map, prepared by a New
                  York investment banker, represents the locations of the
                  transcontinental systems and their connections to eastern and
                  southern railroads. The legend identifies routes for 29
                  companies. The map highlights the impressive complexity of the
                  rail lines in the central United States. The major cities in
                  this region were centers of railroad traffic. Chicago had the
                  largest number of connections with at least 10 lines
                  converging on the city. <br /><br />

                  St. Louis’s riverfront, lined with more than a dozen
                  steamships, is featured on the opening two-page spread of this
                  atlas. Composed of 50 plates, the atlas provides an amazingly
                  detailed bird’s-eye perspective of every street and structure
                  in the city. The rise of steamboats, especially on the
                  Mississippi River, fueled the growth of cities like St. Louis
                  as hubs for trade and transportation. The legend at the bottom
                  of the plates lists many local businesses and manufacturers
                  that relied on the river and these boats. <br /><br />

                  Cutting diagonally across Plate 2 is the Eads Bridge, the
                  first railroad bridge to cross the Mississippi River. This
                  stereograph provides another perspective of the bridge. A
                  group of men stand near the base of one of the arches,
                  providing a sense of scale. The bridge was constructed with
                  steel from Andrew Carnegie’s factories. It opened in 1874 and
                  offered a new way for people and trains to cross the expansive
                  body of water. As the first bridge to be made of steel, it was
                  a breakthrough application for steel, leading to the building
                  of other large structures, including skyscrapers. <br /><br />

                  In 1864, Congress authorized the Northern Pacific Railway
                  Company to construct a northern transcontinental route
                  extending from Minnesota to Washington state. Construction
                  began in 1870, but financial problems hindered progress.
                  Additionally, Native people were aware of the correlation
                  between constructing railroads and the influx of settlers into
                  their homelands and resisted the continued encroachment onto
                  their land. The route was completed in 1883. Rand McNally, a
                  major publisher of railroad maps, printed this map of the main
                  route and tributary routes in the mid-1880s. An alphabetical
                  index identifies the numerous towns and stations serviced by
                  the Northern Pacific and its associated network. <br /><br />

                  The nation’s ethnic and cultural composition changed
                  radically. As U.S. population and power spread across the
                  continent, indigenous peoples suffered genocide, while the
                  remaining tribal nations were forced to move from their
                  homelands onto much smaller reservations. African-Americans
                  had been brought to North America since the beginning of the
                  17th century, but most remained enslaved until the Civil War.
                  Adding to the nation’s cultural diversity, Western European
                  immigrants, largely from Germany and Ireland, came during the
                  first half of the century. By the end of the century,
                  immigrants came from a greater variety of places, including
                  China and southern and eastern Europe. <br /><br />

                  census, the Census Office prepared a landmark atlas featuring
                  an array of thematic maps and statistical graphics. Besides
                  mapping the 1890 distribution of population across the
                  continent, it also included a series of maps that plotted
                  population distribution and density for each decennial census.
                  For example, the 1790 map shows the densest population
                  extending along the Atlantic coast from southern Maine to
                  northeastern Georgia, with scattered clusters extending beyond
                  the Appalachian Mountains. By 1860, the densest populations
                  extended across the eastern half of the country to the Great
                  Plains.

                  In addition to maps, the 1890 “Statistical Atlas” included a
                  variety of innovative graphics. This chart lists major cities
                  from the highest to lowest populations, from New York City to
                  Trenton, New Jersey. Each column to the right features data
                  from an earlier census. A line traces the rise and fall of the
                  city’s population over time. For example, note that New York
                  City has had the highest population since the nation’s first
                  census in 1790. Chicago, in contrast, was not even considered
                  a major city until 1850. The Midwestern hub grew rapidly to
                  become the second largest city by 1890. <br /><br />

                  The founding of Chicago as a transportation, commercial, and
                  industrial hub started in the 1830s, although the area was
                  home to earlier Native, French and U.S. Army activities. The
                  town was surveyed in 1830 and incorporated in 1833, with a
                  population of 350. This 1834 map depicts the original
                  configuration of the streets and blocks, which covered
                  approximately 2.5 square miles. The site consisted of two
                  entire sections and two partial sections in Township 39 North,
                  Range 14 East, of the Third Principal Meridian. The map is
                  color-coded to indicate the dates that various portions of the
                  town were surveyed. <br /><br />

                  Situated on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan, Chicago
                  commanded a short land portage between the Great Lakes and
                  Illinois River, giving it access to the Mississippi River
                  Valley. By 1860, Chicago’s population grew to 110,000, making
                  it the nation’s ninth largest city. This rapid growth is
                  demonstrated with an 1863 map highlighting the real estate
                  subdivisions added to the city. Its geographical footprint had
                  expanded dramatically from the original town plat of 2.5
                  square miles, extending 4-6 miles to the north, south, and
                  west. Throughout this expansion, the street pattern continued
                  to follow the grid pattern guided by General Land Office’s
                  township surveys. <br /><br />

                  From the earliest European settlements in North America
                  through the 19th century, Catholic and Protestant missionaries
                  took part in evangelizing missionary expeditions to Native
                  communities. One particularly active religious group was the
                  Society of Friends, or Quakers. Besides detailing the
                  missionary activities of the various regional Yearly Meetings,
                  their 1844 annual report included this map which shows the
                  extent of each Yearly Meeting as well as the lands in the
                  Great Plains allotted to eastern tribes. It also depicts the
                  distribution of Indigenous communities in the western half of
                  the country. <br /><br />

                  The geography of tribal nations living east of the Mississippi
                  River changed drastically by the 1830s, as depicted on this
                  map accompanying a report concerning the establishment of a
                  new Western Territory reserved for Native people. As American
                  settlers moved into the Ohio River Valley, numerous tribes
                  were forced to cede their lands and relocate west of the
                  Mississippi River. In addition, the 1830 Indian Removal Act
                  mandated the mass removal of the Tsalagi (Cherokee), Mvskoke
                  (Creek), Chahta (Choctaw), Chickasha (Chickasaw), and Semvnole
                  (Seminole) living in southeastern United States. Although this
                  new territory was promised as theirs in perpetuity, it was
                  eventually opened for settlement and statehood for Oklahoma.

                  Enslaved people were introduced into the economy of the 13
                  British North American colonies in the 17th century. By 1860,
                  when this map was published, the enslaved population,
                  primarily of African descent, numbered almost four million
                  people, comprising about 12 percent of the nation's
                  population. This early thematic map uses shades of gray and
                  black to plot the percentage of enslaved people by county for
                  the southern states at the beginning of the American Civil
                  War. In many places enslaved African people greatly
                  outnumbered Whites. Such places often used a variety of laws
                  and practices intended to limit communication, enact terror,
                  and discourage revolts. Rather than a uniform distribution
                  throughout the entire region, chattel slavery was concentrated
                  in several regions where commercial plantation agriculture was
                  most profitable.

                  As the United States transformed, so did its citizenry. Maps
                  and census data document the rapid growth of cities, the
                  forced removals of Native people from their land, and the
                  locations and number of enslaved people in the United States.
                  From 1790 to 1900, the population increased almost twentyfold,
                  growing from 4 million to 76 million. Population densities
                  increased, exhibiting a range of settlement concentrations
                  from family farms and villages to massive cities such as
                  Chicago. The nation’s ethnic and cultural composition changed
                  radically and the relationship between government policy and
                  the people living during this period created dilemmas of
                  inequality and prejudice that we are still dealing with today.

                  As U.S. population and power spread across the continent,
                  indigenous peoples suffered genocide, while the surviving
                  tribal nations were forced to move from their homelands onto
                  much smaller reservations. African Americans, who had been
                  brought to North America since the beginning of the 17th
                  century, mostly remained enslaved until the Civil War. Adding
                  to the nation’s cultural diversity, Western European
                  immigrants, largely from Germany and Ireland, came during the
                  first half of the century. By the end of the century,
                  immigrants were coming from a greater variety of places,
                  including China and southern and eastern Europe.

                  industry on the rise, the population of the United States
                  exploded. Immigrants from Europe and Asia came hoping to get
                  good jobs in factories or to claim land of their own in the
                  west. Black Americans were also increasing in numbers as they
                  rebuilt their families after enslavement, some leaving the
                  south for northern cities and western land opportunities. But
                  growth had a serious price. The government took even more of
                  the small amount of remaining land promised to Native nations,
                  transferring it to settlers and mining and railroad companies.

                  With the construction of a canal and numerous railroads by the
                  1860s, Chicago became a transportation hub linking the East
                  and West. The city emerged as a processing center for natural
                  resources and agricultural commodities produced in the
                  surrounding region. Early fire insurance atlases provide
                  evidence of these economic activities. This sheet, depicting
                  an area along the Chicago River, locates a rail yard with
                  terminal rail lines, coal yards, lumber yards, four grain
                  elevators, four breweries or distilleries, and assorted other
                  factories. Solid lines denote a building’s footprint, while
                  colors represent the construction material based on its
                  likeliness to burn: yellow for wood, pink for brick.<br /><br />

                  As people flocked to cities in the late 19th century,
                  Americans recognized that cities lacked space where locals
                  could enjoy nature and its health benefits. In 1869, Chicago
                  decided that it needed a system of parks and green boulevards.
                  City officials hired Frederick Law Olmsted, who had designed
                  New York City’s Central Park and Boston’s Emerald Necklace.
                  This plan, published in 1871, offers a vision of Chicago with
                  open lawns, trees, and a lagoon along Lake Michigan. This site
                  was chosen for the location of the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair,
                  and today this chain of green spaces is Washington Park, the
                  Midway Plaisance, and Jackson Park.<br /><br />

                  By 1870, Chicago’s population approached 300,000, making it
                  the nation’s fifth largest city. This guide map, published
                  just after the Great Chicago Fire, superimposes the burned
                  area over the gridded street pattern. The fire started
                  southwest of the city center and burned over 2,000 acres,
                  noted by the shaded red area. A strong southwest wind, wooden
                  structures, and summer drought fueled the flames that left
                  approximately 100,000 people homeless. Though legend suggests
                  that a cow caused the flames by knocking over a lantern, the
                  real cause is unknown. In reaction to the mass destruction,
                  city officials and urban planners lobbied for stricter
                  building codes and better fire-fighting services."<br /><br />

                  Two decades later, the Chicago World’s Fair, held in 1893,
                  affirmed that clean, organized cities with public green spaces
                  were the future. This view of Chicago’s 1893 World’s Fair,
                  published by Louis Prang, details the splendor of the
                  remarkable grounds. Daniel Burnham and John Root envisioned
                  the white buildings with neoclassical features while Frederick
                  Law Olmsted designed the landscape. The fair spurred the City
                  Beautiful movement across the country and prompted Chicago to
                  reevaluate its own plans for growth.

                        VIEWPOINT: The World’s Fair was meant to celebrate the
                        achievements of the nations of the world, but the United
                        States told its own story through a deliberate omission
                        of nonwhite stories. Many African Americans “saw no
                        reason for rejoicing when they knew that America could
                        find no representative place for a colored man, in all
                        its work,” as F. L. Barnett wrote in an 1893 pamphlet
                        criticizing the fair. In fact, Haiti made the American
                        abolitionist Frederick Douglass one of their own
                        commissioners to the fair, “through which courtesy the
                        Colored American received from a foreign power the place
                        denied to him at home.”

                  Immigrants often settled in cities like Chicago, where they
                  could find jobs and communities of people from their native
                  countries. In 1889, Jane Addams founded a settlement house in
                  Chicago, called Hull House, offering newcomers childcare as
                  well as classes in English and civics. In this thematic map,
                  based on a survey of the Hull House neighborhood, each color
                  represents a different nation of origin. Italians (dark blue)
                  gathered on some blocks, while others hosted Russian and
                  Polish families (orange). These maps were among the first to
                  illustrate social data as location based.<br /><br />

                  By providing immigrants with programs, classes, events and
                  childcare, the Hull House helped to improve social conditions
                  for underserved people and communities. The Hull House also
                  established the city's first public playground, bathhouse, and
                  public gymnasium. Nurseries, such as the one pictured here,
                  gave mothers the ability to go to work or to attend classes.
                  Children’s programs, such as cobbling and art (among many
                  other offerings), provided learning opportunities for recent
                  immigrants. Yet even while providing services, some urban
                  reformers held to the belief that immigrants were inherently
                  childish, dirty, and in need of moral uplift.<br /><br />

                  At the turn of the century, Chicago became a center of the
                  meatpacking industry as illustrated by these two stereographs.
                  One depicts the Union Stock Yards, a large complex of pens and
                  buildings where cattle were slaughtered and processed. In the
                  background of the image, smoke rises from Chicago’s numerous
                  factories. The other provides a glimpse inside Armour’s
                  Packing House. Rows of hanging pigs represent part of the
                  meatpacking process, in which workers butchered the meat and
                  made sausage. Such jobs attracted numerous Americans and new
                  immigrants to Chicago.<br /><br />

                  Originally displayed at Chicago’s 1893 World Fair, this
                  reconstructed map shows the distribution of major Indigenous
                  language families at the time of European contact. Most maps
                  published in the 1890s only depicted Indian reservations, but
                  this map recognized that Native people originally controlled
                  and inhabited all of North America. The map was compiled by
                  John Wesley Powell, who studied the Colorado River, Grand
                  Canyon, and local Native tribes during the 1870s while leading
                  the Interior Department’s Geographical and Geological Survey
                  of the Rocky Mountain Region. Later, Powell became the first
                  director of the Smithsonian Institution’s Bureau of Ethnology,
                  which archived government records relating to Native people
                  and promoted anthropological research.

                        Viewpoint: The Native American Graves Protection and

                        Ancestors’ remains and cultural items. However,
                        anthropological maps such as this one can create ongoing
                        obstacles. Scholars contend the Tongva (grouped into the
                        outdated Shoshonean language family) moved to Southern
                        California around 4,000 years ago. Some academic and
                        cultural institutions will not return Ancestors to the
                        Tongva that are older than this, stating they belong to
                        tribes that predated the Tongva. Yet our oral traditions
                        say we have always been here. Those are our Ancestors.
                        We want them back.

                  Four western surveys were conducted by the federal government
                  during the 1870s. These survey parties prepared detailed
                  topographic maps, inventoried agricultural and mineral
                  resources, and recorded “vanishing” Indigenous cultures.
                  Photography, still a relatively new technology, was part of
                  this documentation. Timothy O’Sullivan, whose work is
                  displayed here, participated in the War Department’s
                  Geographical Explorations and Surveys West of the 100th
                  Meridian, led by Lt. George M. Wheeler. His photographs were
                  sold commercially as mounted prints and stereographs. Images
                  of Native people were often posed, and label terminology, such
                  as “aboriginal life” and “ready for the war path,” catered to
                  American public stereotypes.<br /><br />

                  According to the 1890 census, almost 15 percent of the
                  country’s total population consisted of foreign-born
                  immigrants, and an additional 33 percent were children of
                  immigrants. These numbers reflect the significance of
                  immigration to the country’s population growth, especially
                  during the late 19th century. This colorful graphic,
                  innovative for its time, consists of pie diagrams for each
                  state showing the percentage of foreign-born people from
                  Canada, China, and twelve European countries. Massachusetts’
                  pie diagram indicates that the largest group came from
                  Ireland, while Canada held second position. In Illinois,
                  Germans formed the largest group, while Irish and
                  Scandinavians composed the second and third largest groups.

                  Prepared by the Census Office using 1890 data, this map
                  illustrates the distribution of population across the country.
                  Darker colors represent denser populations. Based on maps like
                  this, historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared that America
                  no longer had a frontier, which he defined as "the meeting
                  point between savagery and civilization.” He believed that the
                  violent conquest of the West shaped “American character,”
                  marked by rugged individualism, inventiveness, and intuitive
                  mastery over the physical landscape. Many agreed with his
                  “frontier thesis” and feared for rising generations who would
                  no longer have the challenge of fighting native people and
                  dominating a wild landscape.

                        Viewpoint: On the other hand, Native people saw the
                        frontier thesis as a genocidal tactic of forcibly
                        transferring a culture from one state of being to
                        another. Native peoples viewed the frontier as a coming
                        of great change and impending doom. Rather than
                        expansion, the frontier closed in on and choked out
                        Native territories. Cultures that for thousands of years
                        managed and sustained themselves in this “wild
                        landscape” were now forced into American “civilization”
                        and “improvement” as the new American population spread.

                  In addition to thematic maps, the statistical atlas included
                  other graphics illustrating 1890 census data. This chart lists
                  major cities from the highest to lowest populations, from New
                  York City to Trenton, New Jersey. Each column to the right
                  features data from an earlier census. A line traces the rise
                  and fall of each city’s population over time. For example, New
                  York City had the highest population since the nation’s first
                  census in 1790. Chicago, in contrast, was not even considered
                  a major city until 1850. The midwestern hub grew rapidly to
                  become the second largest city by 1890. <br /><br />

                  The 1890 statistical atlas also included maps showing the
                  density of geographic distribution throughout the country for
                  major immigrant groups. This example shows Irish-born
                  immigrants, represented in various shades of brown, lived
                  primarily in New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Midwest.
                  Attracted by jobs constructing canals and railroads and in the
                  growing industrial sector, many Irish immigrants settled in
                  urban areas throughout the northeastern portion of the
                  country. Fears about ethnic purity drove many Anglo Americans
                  at this time to adopt racist ideas about their own threatened
                  supremacy. <br /><br />

                  By the end of the century, Philadelphia was home to 40,000
                  African Americans, comprising the largest population of any
                  northern city. Drawing from the sociological studies by
                  residents of Chicago’s Hull House, African American
                  sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois undertook a similar study in
                  Philadelphia, focusing on Ward 7, the location of the city’s
                  oldest Black neighborhood. In this community with roughly
                  9,700 residents, Du Bois and his associates conducted
                  approximately 5,000 interviews. Their findings were published
                  as <i>The Philadelphia Negro</i> (1899), which included this
                  fold-out map with the location of every residence, church, and
                  business owned by Black people.

                        Viewpoint: The disappearance of historic Black
                        neighborhoods continues. At the end of the 19th century,
                        Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward was the heart of Black
                        Philadelphia. Today, it is a trendy middle-class and
                        white neighborhood. For those that walk these streets,
                        several historic markers and a mural remind us of the
                        Black life once etched into this landscape. Du Bois’
                        maps disrupt the notion of Blacks as a monolithic group
                        by visualizing a far more compelling story of class
                        diversity. This was the place physician Dr. Nathan
                        Mossell, business owner Robert Mara Adger, educators
                        Octavius Catto and Fanny Jackson Coppin, activist
                        Frances Allen Watkins, faith leader Rev. Henry Phillips,
                        junk dealer Arthur McKenzie, waiter Oscar Stewart,
                        dress-maker Bessie Corney, and about 40,000 other Blacks
                        lived and/or worked alongside immigrants and whites.
                        Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church still
                        stands on the edge of this neighborhood. It remains the
                        longest held Black property in the United States while
                        also preserving Black religion, culture, and history.

                  The African American population grew from 4.4 million at the
                  beginning of the Civil War to 7.5 million in 1890,

                  distribution and density. Most African Americans remained in
                  the Southeast, but many moved to Midwestern and Northeastern
                  states. They established communities in urban areas like St.

                  For display at the Paris World’s Fair in 1900, renowned
                  sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois, in collaboration with students
                  and alumni of Atlanta University in Georgia, created a series
                  of infographics illustrating the post-Emancipation progress of
                  African Americans in the United States. These were presented
                  with an exhibition of photographs and written profiles of
                  African Americans from all walks of life. At the bottom of one
                  infographic, a map of the transatlantic slave trade, Du Bois
                  wrote what became a famous rallying point for anti-racists in
                  the years to come: “the problem of the 20th century is the
                  problem of the color-line.”

                  The history of the United States has often been presented as a
                  heroic frontier, with only a few actors: men conquering
                  mountains, exploring the wilderness, expanding the boundaries
                  of a new nation. Left out of this account are the histories of
                  the people indigenous to this land, the enslaved that were
                  transported here against their will, and immigrants relegated
                  to life as second-class citizens. When communities reclaim the
                  power to tell their own stories, and put themselves and their
                  forebears back into a historical record from which they had
                  been previously erased, they not only gain a voice for
                  themselves but also help all of us to understand the past in
                  more inclusive terms.

                  American history in the 19th century contains many stories of
                  hardship and resilience. We must confront tragedy, loss,
                  oppression, and exclusion if we are to fully understand how we
                  arrived at the present day. Rather than feeling overwhelmed by
                  these injustices, however, it is important to consider the
                  actions that we can take in order to grapple with this
                  sometimes bitter legacy. Today, the descendants of Native
                  people and formerly enslaved African Americans, among others,
                  are leading efforts to right the wrongs of the past.

                  ><br />In 2019 Congress held hearings on reparations for
                  slavery. Some believe that the nation should compensate
                  descendants of slaves for hundreds of years of compulsory and
                  unpaid labor. During the hearing, filmmaker Katrina Browne,
                  who discovered that her family owned many slaves, stated that
                  “it is good for the soul of a person, a people, and of a
                  nation to set things right.”

                        What I’m arguing for with reparations is really about
                        not just the financial redress, but how do we deal with
                        the longterm political aftermath of racism in our
                        society? How do we educate the public about the
                        centrality of slavery and the racism that made it
                        possible?

                  Since Euro-Americans settled in what is now the United States,
                  the land has been dramatically altered. Valuable minerals and
                  fossil fuels have been extracted, waterways dammed, and
                  large-scale agriculture enterprises have created jobs for many
                  and great wealth for a select few. These activities have not
                  only caused ecological destruction, but have also deprived
                  Native peoples of their traditional means of supporting
                  themselves. Confronting environmental challenges in the
                  present, therefore, must also involve a commitment to justice
                  for those who have suffered disproportionately from the
                  environmental damages of the past.

                      Native nations continue to serve as land and water
                      protectors, now joined by new allies and organizations. In

                      against the Dakota Access Pipeline, a Rights of Nature
                      statute passed by the Ponca Nation in Oklahoma to oppose
                      fracking and reaffirm their relationship with the land,
                      and opposition to the Thirty Meter Telescope on the sacred

                      Climate and land activism continues to build new
                      coalitions. In the fall of 2019 a series of international
                      strikes and protests were led by young people and adults
                      to demand action be taken to address climate change, even
                      as some states have attempted to prohibit the rights of
                      people to demonstrate. The protection of the land is a
                      burden all must share.

                      Indigenous communities around the world are among those
                      being most quickly and severely affected by climate
                      change. … Our tribe is actively working to move away from
                      fossil fuels and we continue to battle those who disregard
                      our efforts to protect our water and lands.
