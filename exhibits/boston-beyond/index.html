        <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Boston
and Beyond: A Bird’s Eye View of New England</i> celebrates the Boston Public
Library’s remarkable collection of bird’s eye views. These views represent a
unique genre of cartographic materials that were drawn as if the artist viewed
a town from an elevated or bird’s eye view perspective.  They were compiled and published primarily in
North America during the last half of the 19th
century and the early decades of the 20th century. </p><p class="MsoNormal">The collection consists of
approximately 500 such views.  The
exhibit displays a selection of approximately 50 views of New England towns and
cities focusing on Boston, its suburbs, and a
variety of communities in both coastal and interior settings extending from
Cape Cod to the Connecticut River.  Most of these images were drawn and published
by artists in the Boston
area, including Howard H. and Oakes H. Bailey, Edwin Whitefield, Albert F.
Poole, and George W. Walker.</p><p class="MsoNormal">While 17th- and 18th-century
European cartographers depicted many important cities from an elevated aerial
perspective, the 19th-century North American genre is very
distinctive. It proved to be a much more democratic medium, documenting large
cities, towns and small villages in equal style and grandeur.</p><p class="MsoNormal">By comparing these views with
late 19th-century topographic maps, it is evident that the artists
often displayed a perspective and bias in selecting a particular (non-north)
orientation.  A few surviving field
sketch notes and manuscript drawings reveal that the artists did not actually
view their subjects from an elevated perspective, but walked the streets
sketching individual buildings. Then they prepared a composite drawing
depicting the town to its best promotional advantage.</p>

  <h3>Themes</h3>
  <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p><b>The Changing Urban Landscape</b></p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Cities and towns change and grow just like everything else . During the last half of the 19th century, Boston was in a period of major change, growing both horizontally (expanding its shoreline and borders) and vertically (raising its skyline).</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>By comparing the Boston views chronologically, it is possible to document the outward expansion of Boston’s original Shawmut Peninsula as the Back Bay was filled-in and eventually settled.The contrast is clear between Freeman Richardson’s 1864 landscape view in which the Back Bay reclamation has not yet begun and Oakley Bailey’s 1879 map in which it is complete and new real estate developments are rapidly taking hold.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>As Boston’s population outgrew its original physical location, the city also expanded beyond the peninsula into the neighboring townships.Eventually, the City of Boston annexed such communities as East Boston, Roxbury, Dorchester, Jamaica Plain, and Hyde Park. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Boston’s fast-growing population was the result of an active, growing economy and, just as its borders were expanding <i>out, </i>its skyline was also expanding <i>up. </i>In Albert Poole’s 1905 map of Boston, we see the 19th century’s three and four-story buildings replaced by high rise commercial and office buildings. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>As shown in these illuminating maps, Boston’s landscape was changing outward and upward – the natural result of its place at the center of New England commerce and culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p><b>Water Power and Smoke Stacks</b></p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>With the introduction of the Industrial Revolution into New England in the late 18th century and the early 19th century, the region’s economy changed dramatically. Formerly agricultural towns like Waltham, shown in the 1877 view, became industrial centers. Initially small factories were constructed to take advantage of water power sites on New England’s many fast flowing rivers and streams. By the last half of the 19th century when the bird’s eye views were created, these original industrial sites became large industrial complexes utilizing steam power.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Fulfilling their role as agents of boosterism, the bird’s eye view artists emphasized the fast-growing urban functions of their subject cities and towns. In the Waltham view, we see that the focal point is the Boston Manufacturing Company at the heart of a large industrial complex on the Charles River. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p><b>Sails, Ships and the Summer Crowd</b></p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>New England’s coastal towns, many of which date back to the first European settlements in the 17th century, have long looked to the sea for their economic livelihood. Shipping, ship building, whaling and fishing prospered well into the middle of the 19th century. However, as steamships overtook the swift clipper ships and petroleum products replaced whale oil, these communities adapted to changing circumstances. A few, such as Gloucester, continued to prosper as fishing communities. Others, especially those on Cape Cod and the Islands, retained their maritime focus but became summer resorts, offering a relaxing haven for artists and the wealthy. Finally, some including Plymouth, New Bedford, and Providence turned to industry, building factories on the small tributary streams feeding in to the harbor or utilizing steam power. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p><b>All Aboard! Connection Towns by Rail</b></p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>With the adaptation of the steam engine to transportation, trains and their associated iron rails became a major component of southeastern New England’s transportation network during the 19th century. Railroads supplemented already existing roads, turnpikes, and canals, but quickly grew to be the most expeditious means of moving manufactures goods and people over long distances, connecting the inland manufacturing town with each other and Boston, the region’s commercial hub. They proved to be an essential ingredient in New England’s urban and industrial growth in the last half of the 19th century. The prominence of railroad stations in many of the bird’s eye views illustrates both the importance of this transformative transportation technology. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Howard Bailey’s 1875 view of Nashua, New Hampshire, actually shows a railroad station that had yet-to-be built and placed it very prominently in his drawing. In the 1883 depiction of the same city, Bailey’s brother, Oakley, presented the station as it was actually constructed but with much less emphasis, positioning it in the lower right corner. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p><b>The State House Dome, Court House Cupolas, and Church Spires</b></p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Public buildings, such as the Massachusetts State House, county court houses, city halls, churches and schools, as well as public spaces, including town commons and parks, appear in almost every bird’s eye view. However, in some bird’s eye views, the artists displayed these buildings more prominently. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>For example, Fuch’s 1870 view of Boston, which commemorates a July4th celebration, places the Commons, Public Garden, and State House in the center foreground The 1881 view of Malden, published the same year it was incorporated as city, identifies City Hall as number 1 in the legend and places it in the center of the image. In some views, such as the 1877 view of Waltham, the churches appear to be drawn out of proportion to the other buildings,, or in towns, such as Dedham and Barnstable, that serve seats of county government, the county court houses and jails appear in the center of the drawing. </p>

  <h3>1. Beyond but Before</h3>
  <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Although bird’s eye views of North American cities and towns published during the last half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century are considered a unique cartographic genre, there was a precedent for their creation in the history of mapping and imaging cities. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>With the advent of the printing press, European cartographers could employ different perspectives to depict their cities. Some of these views included:</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--list">
    <ul>
        <li>The landscape view -- viewing the town at ground-level; </li>
        <li>The bird’s eye view -- viewing the town from an oblique angle 2,000 -3,000 feet above the ground; </li>
        <li>The traditional map or street plan -- viewing the town directly overhead or from a position perpendicular to the ground. </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Some of the earliest books, especially travel narratives published during the 16th century, included urban views and maps, but the first comprehensive collection of town plans and views was published in 1572 by the German cleric Georg Braun and engraved by Franz Hogenberg. Braun and Hogenberg continued to collect and publish town plans and views, illustrating approximately 500 towns from a variety of perspectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>A distinct 18th-century variation of urban mapping was large multi-sheet wall maps of large and important European cities. Cities mapped in this manner included London, Dublin, Rome, Vienna, Prague, and Paris. Some of these, like the one of Paris displayed here, were drawn from a bird’s-eye perspective. </p>

  <p>Jerusalem, a city sacred to three of the world’s major religions, was depicted as four different images in Braun and Hogenberg’s comprehensive collection of town views.

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>This final image of Jerusalem in <i>Civitates Orbis Terrarum </i>is the most dramatic. Rather than a bird’s eye view, this depiction is more of a pictorial map, showing the facades of buildings placed adjacent to the streets and not drawn in perspective.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>As the extended title indicates, the map was compiled by Christiaan van Adrichem, a Dutch theologian and cartographer, to depict Jerusalem at the time of Christ.

</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The map presents an imaginary conception of the city, with many buildings depicted as 16th century European structures. In addition there are 270 numbered and captioned scenes, showing events mentioned in the Bible and other historical sources. </p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>One of the earliest European attempts to publish a view of a North American city from a bird’s eye perspective is this image titled New Amsterdam. Issued in 1672 by French publisher, Gérard Jollain, it was deliberately mislabeled. Eight years earlier, the British had captured the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam and renamed it New York. <br> </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Not only is the map outdated, it is also completely fictitious! In fact, the street pattern, the buildings, and the hilly topography are those of late 16th-century Lisbon, Portugal. <br>As if he was trying to prove the view’s geographical accuracy, Jollain added an inset showing the relative location of New Amsterdam within the New Holland colony. He also added place names showing the adjacent British colony of Massachusetts and neighboring Indian groups. </p>

  <p>In marked contrast to the small, single-page city views appearing in late 16th and 17th century town atlases, were large, multi-sheet wall maps and bird’s eye views published during the 18th century. These richly detailed urban images depicted Europe’s largest and most important cities. Displayed here is one page from a 20-sheet view of Paris, drawn from a bird’s eye perspective. <br></p>

  <p>This large scale drawing of Paris was prepared by Louis Bretez, a sculptor, painter, and specialist in perspective drawings. It took Bretez five years to complete this work. Here the city is viewed from the northwest, looking southeast, with the Seine River running through the middle of the composition. Bretez also places Île de la Cité and Île St. Louis, the historic heart of the city, near the center of the image.</p>

  <h3>2. Boston</h3>
  <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>As New England’s largest city and commercial hub, Boston was documented in more urban views than any other New England community. Nine of these, dating from 1850 to 1905, are displayed here. They view the city from different elevations and different perspectives or orientations. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Several are landscape views, but most depict the city from a bird’s eye perspective. The views are from all around the peninsula – northwest, northeast, east, southeast, southwest, and west. Consequently, each view emphasizes a different aspect of the city’s geography – public spaces (State House, Commons, and Public Garden), transportation facilities (harbor wharves and warehouses, railroad stations), and central business district (commercial and financial buildings).</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>This chronological sequence also documents the city’s changing geography during the last half of the 19th century. These views provide evidence of the city’s physical growth as various land fill projects were completed, such as infilling between wharves and land reclamation in the Back Bay and South Cove areas. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The tension between ship and rail is evident, as the city’s significance as a railroad center outdistanced its maritime activities. Simultaneously the city’s changing skyline, initially marked by the State House, the Bunker Hill Monument, churches, and three or four-story commercial buildings, became increasingly dominated by ten to twelve-story commercial buildings, highlighting the city’s emerging importance as a financial and commercial hub. </p>

  <p>John Bachmann, a German immigrant, was one of the earliest and finest producers of urban bird’s eye views. During his career, he published two views of Boston – one in 1850 and the other in 1877. </p>

  <p>In this early version, Bachmann viewed the city from the southwest, looking directly at the Public Garden and the Common, with the remainder of the downtown greatly diminished by perspective.

  <p>Richardson’s 1864 landscape view of Boston’s environs provides another example of a ground-level or low-elevation urban view published during the 1850s and 1860s when bird’s eyes views were just beginning to gain in popularity. Published in 1864 at the end of the Civil War, this pastoral landscape belies the notion that Boston was an active participant in a turbulent and destructive war that the Union barely survived. </p>

  <p>In this presentation, Boston is viewed from the southwest. Using Corey Hill in Brookline as his vantage point, the artist placed Brookline’s semi-rural landscape in the foreground, with the yet unfilled Back Bay and city proper fading into the horizon. While Brookline appears to be a residential community, Boston proper is more densely settled, with smoke stacks, church steeples, and commercial buildings punctuating the skyline. </p>

  <h3>3. Annexed Suburbs</h3>
  <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>In addition to the dramatic and stunning depictions of Boston Proper, many bird’s eye views were also prepared for Boston’s suburban neighbors. These images document the suburbanization stimulated by a growing network of street car lines and annexation during the last half of the 19th century.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Many of these neighboring communities, now part of the larger Boston metropolitan region, were established as separate townships during the 17th century. They developed as small agricultural villages during the 18th century, while their neighbor Boston, whose growth was confined to the original Shawmut Peninsula, became the primary port for the Massachusetts colony. As Boston’s growth expanded beyond the peninsula through the various landfill projects, these independent towns were engulfed in Boston’s suburban expansion.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>East Boston, Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, Mattapan and Hyde Park were annexed by Boston. Although part of the incorporated City of Boston, they still represent identifiable neighborhoods, but often without discreet boundaries. Brookline, Cambridge, Arlington, Malden, Newton, Watertown, Waltham, Quincy, and Dedham remained independent towns. All are located within Boston’s primary circumferential beltway (Route 128) and are an integral part of Boston’s urbanized area.</p>

  <p>Whitefield was well known as an artist of urban views during the middle of the 19th century. Between 1845 and 1878 he produced fifty-nine lithographic views of cities and towns throughout the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>In comparison to bird’s eye views produced by other artists, Whitefield’s appear stark and spare. There is little sense of boosterism. None of the buildings appear exaggerated or drawn out of proportion to the other buildings and the unlabeled streets are minimally populated.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>What is pictured is a quiet country village, which was a fairly accurate portrayal. Dedham, founded in 1635 as one of the colony’s first inland towns, became the county seat of Norfolk County in 1793. Although a center of transportation, it was not noted for its heavy industry. </p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>In a small notebook labeled “Dedham,” Whitefield maintained the subscription list for his bird’s eye view of the central village. In his introductory comments, he stated his intention of publishing a “centennial” view of Dedham as it appeared in 1876. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>He indicated that it would be compiled from original drawings that he recorded. He also proposed that the published view would measure from 20 to 35 inches, reaching the latter dimension only if he was able to obtain 200 subscriptions at $5.00 per copy. Apparently, Whitefield did not meet his goal since only about 100 subscribers agreed to purchase the view and the lithographic view measures 28 inches in length.</p>

  <h3>5. Coastal Towns</h3>
  <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>New England’s urban network developed within two different physical landscapes – at the edge of the ocean shore and along interior rivers and streams. These settings provided the basis for towns with different economic activities. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Arriving primarily from England, the first European settlers established their towns and villages along the coastline, taking advantage of the many well protected harbors. Seaports and fishing communities prospered in these locations. During the colonial period, these coastal communities developed an active maritime trade, carrying goods to and from England, the Caribbean, and the other British North American colonies. In addition, shipping, fishing, and whaling became important occupations. These pursuits prospered well into the 19th century, but declined as the swift clipper ships were replaced by steamships and whale oil was replaced with petroleum products.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>As maritime activities diminished in the coastal towns during the last half of the 19th century, some of these communities turned to industry, building factories on the small tributary streams feeding into the harbor or utilizing steam power. Others, especially those on the Cape and the Islands, became summer resorts, offering a relaxing haven for the nation’s and the region’s wealthy citizens. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>It was during this transitional period, that the bird’s eye view artists captured New England’s coastal towns. The artists typically viewed the towns from the water as if approaching from the sea, emphasizing their maritime activities. Orienting the views from a seaward approach meant that most did not have north at the top of the page.</p>

  <p>Incorporated as a town in 1763, Newburyport is located near the mouth of the Merrimack River. It flourished as a center for shipping, shipbuilding, and whaling during the colonial period and as a port for privateering during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. </p>

  <p>During the 19th century, shipbuilding continued to be an important, but declining, activity.

  <p>Gloucester was established as a town in 1642 and incorporated as a city in 1873. By the middle of the 18th century it was an important shipbuilding center, especially known for its schooners.

  <h3>6. Inland Towns</h3>
  <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>As Boston became New England’s primary port, European settlement spread inland from the coastal villages and towns, in a pattern that followed the Charles, Merrimack, Blackstone, and Connecticut Rivers. Initially, as new townships were established, the primary inland settlements were small agricultural villages. With the advent of the industrial revolution at the end of the 18th century and during the first half of the 19th century, some of the earliest factories were constructed near water power sites on the small, fast flowing rivers and tributary streams by these villages. With the construction of canals and railroads to connect these villages to Boston and the adoption of steam powered engines to run the factories, many of these villages grew into major industrial towns during the last half of the 19th century. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>It was during the height of this industrial activity, which was tied to railroads and steam powered engines, that the bird’s-eye view artists documented a very large number of southeastern New England’s inland cities, towns, and villages. The artists had no rule books, but they often depicted these communities by placing emphasis on the rivers, the railroads, and the associated factories. No specifications or guidelines told the artists what to include or leave out. They only needed to satisfy the city fathers who commissioned the project and the town’s upper and middle classes, who would become the potential buyers of the published views. Consequently, these bird’s eye views became “Chamber of Commerce” documents promoting local industrial or commercial activities. </p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Located on the Merrimack River, Manchester is viewed from the west bank of the river looking east across the town. By using such an orientation, the artists were able to place the large number of factories located along the river and the parallel canal in the foreground.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Manchester’s Amoskeag Company was established in the 1830s with an influx of capital from Boston financiers. By the end of the 19th century, the company had grown to become the largest cotton textile manufacturer in the world. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The Amoskeag Company was also instrumental in establishing and planning the town. In contrast to most other New England villages, Manchester was designed with a grid street pattern. The plan included wide tree-lined streets and parks. Adjacent to the factories, the company also built long rows of tenement housing for the workers.</p>

  <p>Worcester, the state’s third largest city in1880, is viewed from the south in this Bailey and Hazen view.

  <p>Worcester had a diversified industrial base, as evidenced by the thirty factories listed in the legend. Similar to other bird’s eye views published by Howard H. Bailey and Hazen, this one identifies no churches, although public buildings and colleges are listed.</p>

  <p>Located on a bend of the Connecticut River adjacent to Hadley Falls, the industrial city of Holyoke is viewed from the southeast in this bird’s eye view. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Although settled in the early 18th century, large-scale industrial development did not become important in Holyoke until the late 1840s, when a group of Boston industrialists constructed a dam and canals and planned a company town. Laying out the town with a grid street pattern, these investors envisioned an industrial community comparable to Lowell or Lawrence.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>While the grid pattern still displays many empty spaces, the legend contains forty-six entries, most of which were industries. Of these at least sixteen were paper mills, from which the community gained the nickname “Paper City.” Only one public building is identified – city hall. None of the four or five churches are identified.</p>

  <p>Located on the inside of a large meander of the Connecticut River, Northampton is viewed from the east with a vantage point above the river’s wide flood plain. Ignoring the river, the drawing is oriented toward the west, emphasizing its bucolic, hilly setting. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>By the end of the 19th century, Northampton, originally an agricultural community, boasted a diversified economy. Most of its factories were located near the Mill River and the railroad track.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The legend also recognizes the city’s importance as a resort destination and the setting for specialized societal institutions. Located on the city’s fringes, these institutions included Smith Female College, founded in 1871 and now the nation’s largest liberal arts college for women; Clarke School for the Deaf, the nation’s oldest oral school for the deaf; and a lunatic hospital, now Northampton State Hospital. </p>
