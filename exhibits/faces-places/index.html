  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>One of the goals of <i>Faces &amp; Places</i> is to create an environment that will inspire dialogue, encouraging us to understand each other's cultural heritage, learn how we are different, but still realize how much we have in common. In creating this exhibition, we selected a number of historical maps that portray the countries from which the greatest number of Bostonians originate. These maps depict the countries at various stages in their historical, geographical, political, and economic development. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>According to the 2000 census, the eight countries whose immigrant population informs the cultural diversity of the city of Boston are Cape Verde, China, Dominican Republic, England, Haiti, Ireland, Italy, and Jamaica. Immigrants from each of the countries represented in this exhibition celebrate the culture that is their heritage in different ways in their new home.</p>

  <p><b>Themes: Understanding the Exhibition</b></p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--list">
    <ul>
        <li><i>Navigation and Exploration</i>: As people began to travel beyond their borders, maps were used to provide increasingly accurate means to help plan and guarantee that the financial and physical risks they were taking would be as successful as possible.</li>
        <li><i> Remembering Home</i>: Central to the immigrant experience is maintaining strong ties to one’s homeland and culture. Maps are often used to remind us that a powerful sense of place is a foundation for adjustment to one’s new land.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--list">
    <ul>
        <li><i>Tourism</i>: Travel for recreational purposes has increased and is no longer the purview of the very wealthy. Tourist maps are an integral part of this new demand for information about foreign places.</li>
        <li><i>Transportation</i>: As the means of travel expanded on land and sea, so too did the ways in which these routes were portrayed on maps. Travelers were provided information that anticipated their needs as they went to unfamiliar places.</li>
        <li><i>Urban Culture</i>: Cities play an important role in the journeys of all immigrants. Urban maps provide a detailed visual representation of changing landscapes informed by these multi-dimensional cultures.</li>
        <li><i>Global Interaction</i>: Globalization during the last two centuries has increased interaction between nations with different cultures, often resulting in contentious encounters. Maps are an integral part of nations dealing with these challenges.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Founded in 1630, Boston is one of America's oldest cities. Laid out on a narrow, hilly peninsula jutting into Boston Bay, the "Town of Boston" grew into a bustling seaport by the mid-18th century based on its commerce with many ports in the British colonial empire. Not only was Boston the main administrative center of British government in the Massachusetts colony, it was colonial AmericaԳ largest city until 1760, when it was surpassed by Philadelphia. Nevertheless, it continued to maintain its position as the primary port of entry for the New England region. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Without a rich agricultural hinterland like other colonial American port cities (i.e. Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Charleston), Boston in its early years turned to maritime interests including fishing, whaling, ship building, and shipping. Following the American Revolution, Boston was transformed from a colonial seaport confined by the physical limits of the Shawmut peninsula, to a large regional city. This feat was accomplished by creating new land adjacent to the peninsula and integrating the neighboring villages to the southwest, as well as the towns on the north side of the Charles River. Except for Hong Kong, Boston has the largest amount of man-made land in any city. <br> </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>As Boston grew and prospered during the 19th century, it also became the hub of the regionԳ transportation network, with roads and railroads radiating out from the city to most parts of New England. In addition, extensive industrialization aided by an immigrant labor force supplemented BostonԳ commercial and financial success. <br> </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Throughout its history, immigrants from many countries have played a critical role in the development and economic vitality of Boston. While immigrants from England were responsible for establishing the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies in the 17th century, the English continued to be a major immigrant population in Boston throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Beginning in the early 19th century, Irish immigrants dominated the city. By the end of that century and throughout much of the first half of the 20th century, Italians provided the largest number of newcomers to Boston. As the 20th century came to a close, although England, Ireland, and Italy still accounted for much of the immigrant population of the city, new arrivals from China, the Cape Verde Islands, and the Caribbean island nations of Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica enhanced the colorful tapestry of culture and tradition in the city of Boston.</p>

  <p><b>Henry Pelham (1749-1806) <br><i>A Plan of Boston in New England </i><br>London, 1777</b></p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>This most important battle plan of the New England theater of war shows, in detail, the American fortifications on Dorchester Heights forcing the British to leave Boston in 1776. This was the best printed plan of the city of Boston and its environs, to date. Finely engraved in aquatint and beautifully printed on heavy paper, this copy is one of perhaps six known examples signed in manuscript by the author. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Pelham, a Loyalist, was born in Boston in 1748/9. The note that was engraved in the upper left of this map is a copy of the passport issued to Pelham two months after the Battle of Bunkers-Hill, giving him permission to examine the enemy lines. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The aquatint is of interest, because of its high quality. It is known that Pelham consulted John Singleton Copley (Pelham's half brother) regarding the production of this map. Pelham was eleven years Copley's junior, and there is little question that Pelham learned to draw from his accomplished elder. The outstanding result is without question the finest cartographical print relating to the Revolutionary War. </p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Although undated, this earliest surviving plan of Boston Harbor dates from the period of Sir Edmund Andros' term as governor of New England from 1685-1689. It is most likely one of several manuscript maps of New England sent by Andros back to the Board of Trade in London. Andros was known to have received orders to secure a map of Boston Harbor as early as April 1688. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The chart was prepared by Phillip Wells, one of the most highly skilled of early American cartographers, based on information provided by several ship captains. Few other important 17th-century manuscript maps of the New England colonies have survived. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>It is also of interest that the earliest printed chart of Boston Harbor, which was published as part of The English Pilot: The Fourth Book (1689), shows many similarities to this map.</p>

Many people emigrated from Cape Verde during the 1980s because devastating droughts caused economic activity on the islands to stagnate.</p>

My older brother is seven years older, and my younger brother is seven years younger. I am Cape Verdean. Cape Verde is an island off the West coast of Africa. The atmosphere is warm and the beaches are beautiful. In Cape Verde, we speak Portuguese and Cape Verdean Creole. I speak Cape Verdean Creole fluently with my family at home. My parents speak Portuguese, but I don't. My mother speaks five languages, and they are as follows: English, Spanish, Cape Verdean Creole, French, and Portuguese. My mom makes great use of her languages, because she works as an interpreter at Boston Medical Center. My parents came to this country about 20 years ago. I still have family in Cape Verde, who I last visited when I was seven. I look forward to visiting them again. <br><br>I visited Cape Verde in 1997. I loved it. I was visiting my aunts and uncle and my grandma. I was at the beach all day, every day. I was extremely warm, and the waves were awesome. There are ten islands in Cape Verde. The sandy beaches are beautiful. Some islands were volcanic, so the sand is black. The other islands have white sand that feels like silk under your feet. The water has a sapphire blue, crystal clear color to it. It is also warm and refreshing. There is a dance we call "pasada," which means passing. The dance symbolizes all negative things passing you by.

  <p>Although drawn and engraved in 1746 by Bellin, one of the most prolific mid-18th-century French cartographers, this map of the Cape Verde islands was published in the 1780 edition of Jean-Francois de la Harpe's Abrege de l 'histoire generale des voyages. The map depicts the Cape Verde Islands, a small group of volcanic islands located in the tropical waters of the Atlantic, about 15º north of the Equator and 385 miles west of the African country of Senegal.</p>

  <p>These islands were discovered and settled by the Portuguese in the 1450s and 1460s. During the subsequent centuries, the French and British tried to gain control, but the islands remained under Portuguese domination until 1975 when they gained independence.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Published by Robert Laurie and James Whittle, London mapmakers and engravers who were active in the early 1800s, this navigational chart used rhumb or directional lines to assist navigators in plotting their course to and from the Cape Verde Islands.

  <p>The headland views or coastal silhouettes in the upper right and the lower insets of the map assisted sailors in identifying the various islands as they approached from the sea.

Upon entering Praya Bay on the island of St. Iago, the navigator could refer to the depth chart in the upper left corner to make a safe passage. </p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>This map of the west coast of Africa was first engraved in 1738 by order of Jean-Frederic Phelypeaux, Count of Maurepas and Secretary of State under the French King Louis XVI. The map is a microcosm of African colonialism during this period; the Cape Verde islands were in the hands of the Portuguese, the Canaries were occupied by the Spanish, the French controlled Senegal on the mainland, while Morocco, incredibly, remained independent. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>With much at stake for the occupying power, accurate maps were of critical importance for navigators and politicians alike. The accurate placement of islands was especially important for navigation -- hundreds of ships had been lost on the rocks or islands that appeared where the ship's navigator did not expect them to be. Hence, the emphasis in this map on accurate longitude of capes and islands, and the legend in the lower right corner explaining the method used for determining latitude and longitude for particularly dangerous locations.</p>

  <p>This mid-18th-century map of Africa includes fictitious place names that are often found in African maps of this era, such as the mysterious and mostly unexplored interior regions here called Monomotapa and Monoemugi, located in southern Africa. Monomotapa, far from being the name of a nation, was in fact the name used for the leader of the Makaranga tribe that lived in south central Africa. For reasons unknown, it became a standard geographical designation during this period and is found on numerous maps of southern Africa as the name of a nation, not of a person.</p>

  <p>While the interior parts of Africa were still relatively unknown to Europeans during the mid-18th century, maps from this time period show relatively accurate information for the coastal areas.

  <p>This fascinating map of Africa comes from a revised Italian edition of Le Sage's Atlas Historique, first published in London in 1802. This atlas was also published for several decades in foreign editions, one of which was Italian, by Girolamo Tasso in 1830. </p>

There are also comments about the voyages of Vasco de Gama in 1497 and 1498 around the Cape of Good Hope and Marco Polo's voyage to Madagascar.

  <p>Le Sage, whose real name was Emmanuel Marie Joseph Auguste Dieudonné, Comte de Las Cases, took on the pseudonym Le Sage, because, in his words, he wanted to preserve his family's name and honor from desecration by would-be critics of the Atlas. He accompanied Napoleon during his imprisonment on the island of St. Helena from 1815 to 1821, and later published the former Emperor's memoirs under his given name. It is not a coincidence that this map points out and describes the island of St. Helena in the southern part of the Gulf of Guinea, and describes Napoleon's imprisonment there. </p>

          <p><i>I remember when my parents were talking about moving. At first I thought that we were just going to move to a new house or a new city, but never did I think we were going to move from Taiwan to America. I had just come home from a long hot day of school. For nine hours I was in a small classroom with forty-five other kids. The temperature that day was 90 degrees as usual. When I got home, I had tons of homework. Normally my homework took about three hours to do, but that day I had four hours of homework because kids in my second grade homeroom class were throwing paper balls. I got home at 3:00. I knew if I didn't start my homework soon it would take until ten o'clock to finish. So I got out a few pieces of lined paper, a sharpened pencil, and started working. I had to make sure that I finished all of my homework that night because if I went to school the next day with missing work my homeroom teacher would hit me with a long thin bamboo stick that hurts so much it makes you cry. <br></i><i><br></i><i>In school everyone was trying to get the perfect grade, and it was rare for someone to get a 70 on a test. All the parents pressured their kids to be the smartest. My parents didn't really care about pushing me to make the A. They wanted me to enjoy school instead of stressing me to be the best. I was half way done with my homework when my mom told my sister and me to come downstairs. "I have some good news," said my mom. "We are moving." I got so excited. "Where" I said, "Are we moving to a new town?" "No," said my mom. "A new city?" No. "A new state?" No. "Disneyland?" said my little sister. "No," my mom said for the last time. We are moving to America," my father finally said. My family looked glad like it was something good. I didn't know about them, but I wasn't ready to let go of all my family, all my friends, my house, and I wasn't ready to give up my life in Taiwan. "Why?" I asked my mom. "Because we think going to America will make things easier for us, you know better schools, and a cleaner place to live with no pollution," said my mom. That night I didn't even finish my homework. I couldn't concentrate because I had too much on my mind. I didn't even care if I got hit, I can take the pain. <br><br></i><i>Two weeks passed and everyday I could see people moving our stuff away. My house was now missing chairs, tables, and other furniture. It looked like an incomplete dollhouse when I walked in. I could only bring a few dolls and books. "Nothing heavy," my mom said. "We'll get more new toys when we are in America." But I didn't want more toys. I liked how things were. <br><br></i><i>Finally the day came, we were leaving that Monday afternoon and leaving everything behind. I took one last look at my house it was empty as a drum but I could still picture where all the furniture used to be. As I walked out of the house, so many memories just rushed through my mind like I was shot by a thousand bolts of memories. <br></i><i><br>When I got on the airplane, I thought to myself that in 23 hours I would be half way around the globe. When we landed in San Francisco a tall man with light blond hair came up and spoke to me in strange words I had never heard before. When I arrived in Boston I lived in my aunt's house. She was very rich and we came together with my other aunts and uncle. My wealthy aunt had nine rooms in her house. We lived on the third floor for nine months. <br><br></i><i>I remember my first day in an American school. I entered class with about 16 students it was less than half of the students in my old class. Everyone came from different countries, but they all knew how to speak English. Many kids came up to me and started talking and I had no idea what they were saying. So I would say to them, "Me no English go away!" I felt stupid for a while I had no clue what was going on in the class. The only thing that I understood was math. In Taiwan, we were way ahead with our mathematics. I had already memorized the multiplication table from 1-12 while they were still learning it. When my teacher gave me my first American homework I didn't know how to do it. So that night I just went to sleep. The next day I thought I was going to get hit, but all the teacher said was "that's okay, at least you tried." I was amazed no teacher in Taiwan was that nice to me before. Maybe it was a good thing that we moved and maybe it will all work out for the best. </i></p>

</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>A Chinese view of the world is provided by this unusual woodcut and hand-colored map. The primary emphasis is China, but Europe and the British Isles are represented as a very thin sliver of uncolored land and islands in the upper left corner. The upper two vignettes, however, depict the world in the European context of two hemispheres – to the left are Eurasia and Africa, and to the right, Asia, Antarctica, and the Americas. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The seventeen provinces of China dominate the main section of the map. They are outlined and colored, with cities, towns, and villages indicated by woodcut stamps of their names. Rivers, mountains, the Great Wall of China and the Gobi Dessert are also depicted using simple pictorial symbols. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>A late nineteenth-century commentator has translated into English several of the Chinese labels. As is typical for world maps from non-European cultures, distant lands are depicted as mysterious and exotic. For example, a note on Brazil identifies it as the "land of the cannibals."</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The map includes several clues as to its origin. In the upper left vignette, China is identified as the "Qing Empire," implying that the map dates from before the fall of the Ching dynasty and the Chinese Empire in 1911. In addition, a late nineteenth-century handwritten note in the lower right margin refers to a rebellion in "Yung Ngan," almost certainly the Muslim Rebellion that took place in the province of Yunnan between 1855 and 1873. The text block at the upper left includes a reference to one "Jungmen Chen," the cartographer, while in the central upper text block, the patron who commissioned the map is identified as "Junliang Ma, from the Zhejiang province."</p>

  <p>On February 4, 1912, P'u Yi, the last emperor of China, abdicated the throne with these words: "Today the people of the whole empire have their minds bent on a republic, the southern Provinces having begun the movement, and the northern generals having subsequently supported it. The will of providence is clear and the people's wishes are plain. How could I, for the glory and honor of one family, oppose the wishes of teeming millions? Wherefore I, the Emperor, decide that the form of government in China shall be a Constitutional Republic." </p>

  <p>With the advent of a constitutional republic in China, Westerners for the first time had access (albeit limited) to China's extraordinary treasures. The National Geographic Magazine devoted its entire October 1912 issue to China -- its canal infrastructure, the Forbidden City, and its artistic, cultural, and architectural treasures. This map, which was included with that issue as a special supplement, was based on the cartography of the British firm, J.G. Bartholomew.</p>

The lower right inset shows land and sea routes in and around China, while the surrounding insets focus on the cities of Peking, Shanghai, and Canton. One special symbol identifies certain cities along the coast or major waterways in China as so-called "treaty ports," special urban centers that had been granted foreign commerce rights by the Chinese government.</p>

</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>American journalist and advertising executive Carl Crow designed this colorful and user-friendly map of Shanghai. He was the founder of the Chun Mei News Agency, which was responsible for translating and disseminating English language news printed in Shanghai into Chinese. He also wrote over a dozen books about China including several travelers' guides. The vignettes around the map show important moments in Chinese history as well as facades of buildings and cultural monuments. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, who sponsored the preparation of this map, was an international governing body that was active in Shanghai from 1863 until the Japanese occupation in 1941. The seal of the Council demonstrates the international flavor of Shanghai in the early 20th century, with flags from twelve nations represented. Adding to the international flavor of the map is the diagram showing the time differences between Shanghai and cities around the world. The inset map at the lower right places Shanghai in geographical context, and also shows a basic outline of the different "settlements" of the city -- Chinese, French, and "International" (i.e., British and American). For some time, each of these settlements functioned as a miniature principality, administered and managed by its expatriate citizens. This assumption of Chinese authority angered many Chinese Shanghai residents and led to civil unrest. In retrospect, the motto of the Council, "Omnia juncta in uno" (All joined into one), seems rather optimistic in the face of Chinese disenfranchisement and discontent.</p>

  <p>In 1620, a group of Pilgrims fled religious persecution in England and sailed on the <i>Mayflower </i>to America. The group landed in Plymouth and established a colony. In 1630, with Puritan settlements around the Massachusetts Bay area, a group of settlers established Boston, named for a town in Lincolnshire, England. Between the years of 1630-1643, 20,000 Puritan English men and women arrived in Boston and the Massachusetts Bay Colony. This massive migration was the result of tensions brewing in England between Protestants and Anglicans that would eventually lead to the English Civil War of 1643. Throughout the next two centuries, immigrants from England came to America for new economic opportunities and eventually for the freedoms promoted in the United States of America.</p>

          <p><i>I am not a traitor. I did not fight in the Revolutionary War for the Crown, but my great-great-great-great grandfather did fight for the Crown. In the following paragraphs, you will hear the story of Captain John Hatfield and my other British ancestors. <br> <br>John Hatfield was born in England in the 1740s. He traveled to America around 1774 and married Mary Lockerman on June 28, 1778 in Trinity Church, New York City. He served with the British before the Revolutionary War and late in the Provincial Regiment of the Loyalist of New Jersey Π3rd New Jersey volunteers. On April 15, 1777, he was appointed captain. The reason that it was reasonable for him to fight in the British Army was because that was his culture. <br> <br>If I had the opportunity to talk to Mr. Hatfield, I would say to him that he should fight for the American army instead of the loyalists because Britain is taxing the Americans without any representation in the British Parlaiment. Being taxed for another country's economic problems was not fair. At the end of the Revolutionary War, John Hatfield was unable to stay in America. After obtaining a land grant for 700 acres of land, he settled in Parrsboro, Canada. He died in 1804, having settled in Fox River, Nova Scotia. I don't think it was fair that John Hatfield was forced to leave America because I thought America was the land of the free. America is a country where people can choose when and where to do things as long as it doesn't break the law. Losing the war was punishment enough. <br> <br>My great grandfather, Wallace Crane Gilbert, moved from Nova Scotia to Waterville, Maine, in 1920. He married a woman named Leona Pekie and moved to Boston, Massachusetts. When he moved to Boston, he put himself through school at Wentworth Institute and became a master plumber. He moved to America from Nova Scotia due to a lack of work in Canada. I think it was a good decision, because he was starting a good future for his children. My ancestors, the Hatfields, were in a very famous fight. It was called the Hatfield/McCoy feud. The Hatfields and the McCoys were neighbors who always competed and fought against one another. I think this was stupid, because they were fighting over small things. I really respect my British ancestors. They all traveled from Britain to America to Canada and back to America. It must have been very hard for them when no one in America welcomed them, and Canada did not have good job opportunities. </i></p>

  <p>These two maps, portraying portions of Cornwall and Wales, were originally prepared by Gerard Mercator, one of the greatest of early Dutch map makers. These two atlas sheets were published in either the 1628 or 1633 French edition of Mercator and Jodocus Hondius’s Atlas. Originally published in 1595, this book of maps was the first such publication to use the term “atlas” to describe a collection of published maps. The use of this term is often associated with the Greek Titan, Atlas, who was condemned by Zeus to carry the heavens and earth on his shoulders for all time. </p>

</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Despite the title’s suggestion that this is a geological map, it is much more. It not only shows the standard cartographical features, such as roads, railroads and stations, canals, steamboat passages, towns, cities, counties, and distances for all of the British Isles, it is also an electoral map, as it indicates the number of parliamentary seats for each borough.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Electoral representation was a topic of particular importance in early- and mid-19th century Britain. Population decline in many formerly important centers combined with the implementation of representation policies that were hundreds of years old meant that many towns and villages with only a few dozen residents or even less, had the right to elect members of the House of Commons. Newer industrial centers such as Manchester, meanwhile had no representation at all. The electoral reforms of 1832 revised this system to provide at least nominally equitable representation.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>By including this electoral data, the map maker, James Wyld, the younger (1812-1887), added a human element to the otherwise purely structural elements of the maps – it is a map of Brits as well as of Britain.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>England’s geography at the close of the American Revolution is portrayed on this map by Thomas Kitchen, hydrographer to the British King. Administratively, the country was divided into shires or counties, the names of which were often transplanted to towns and counties in British North America. According to the legend, there was also a well-ordered hierarchy of urban settlements, identified as cities, county towns, boroughs, market towns, and villages. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The importance of London as the country’s administrative and financial center is evidenced by the numbers placed alongside many town names, indicating the distance from that town to London. To assist in locating these places, the map also has a well-marked grid of longitude and latitude. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>On this map, longitude is measured east or west from London, using a north-south line or prime meridian running through the Greenwich observatory outside London. By the end of the 19th century, the Greenwich Prime Meridian was accepted as the international standard. Prior to that time various prime meridians were used by different cartographers.</p>

Many Irish, fearing the political repercussions of a union that left England in control, fled to the United States and particularly to Boston. A decade later the infamous Potato Famine swept through the island nation and brought a second wave of Irish immigrants to Boston.</p>

But it is rarely heard, so no one really uses it any more. Some words like gille, which means boy, and Iain, which means John, are some Gaelic words. My mother's grandmother came from Ireland and moved to Roxbury. After that, she moved to West 7th Street in South Boston. When my mother and siblings were growing up, she moved them to the Old Colony Projects. After she died, my mother and her siblings broke up and moved around South Boston and Roslindale. <br> <br>My mother met my dad when she was 37 years old. Then in two years they had me, the best Irish son. When I was born, my features were pail white skin, with bright reddish hair -- what almost every Irish person looks like. <br> <br>I grew up in a neighborhood where there are no Irish families, and most families are African-American. Nevertheless, I have learned that back in the 1800s, families in Ireland moved to the U.S. and Australia because of the potato famine. There are many more Irish people in the United States than there are in Ireland. <br> <br>In Boston, there is an Irish festival where Irish men and women get together and celebrate a holy day. That holiday we call St. Patrick's Day. It is a time of celebration where my family comes together for a huge feast. </i></p>

  <p>Published by the U.S. Army Map Service, the map series of which this map of Ireland is a part, had its origins in an ambitious project called the International Map of the World. The idea, conceived by German geographer Albrecht Penck, was to create a series of 2,500 topographic map sheets that would cover the planet, all in the same scale of 1 centimeter equals 10 kilometers (or 1:1,000,000). </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>In 1913, an international conference established standards and practices for the project, giving each participating country responsibility for creating its own maps. Although the project was eventually taken over by the United Nations, funding and international enthusiasm soon waned. After World War II, several countries (including the United States and the United Kingdom) published their own world map series at a scale of 1:1,000,000. </p>

  <p>The largest group of Italians came to Boston and America between the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. During this period of great migration, most of the immigrants came from southern Italy. After the unification of Italy in 1861, under Victor Immanuel II, Italy began to industrialize. By 1878, at the start of the reign of Humbert I, the gap between the more industrialized north and the more rural agricultural south grew larger. A population explosion in the south prompted many southern Italians to migrate north to find jobs. Many also decided to immigrate to the United States. These southern Italians, accustomed to an agrarian economy, had to adjust to the new industrial urban lifestyle in Boston. A second wave of Italian families immigrated to the United States during the first half of the 20th century as many people tried to escape Mussolini, Fascism and two world wars.</p>

          <p><i>My name is M. Bianchi. In English, Bianchi means White, but in Italian, it means something different. The reason why it means something different in Italian is because when they translated the word, Bianchi was not phrased correctly. The lesson is because the Italian language does not fit the English language vocabulary. <br> <br>1923 was the year my great grandfather came to America. His name was Larry. He probably changed his real name to Larry so it would sound more American. My great grandfather went back to marry my great grandmother in Italy and bring her back to America with him. They moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Later on, they moved to Boston because they found out that relatives were living there. <br> <br>My great grandfather lived on the outskirts of Rome in a city that is now dead. The reason why my great grandfather moved her was because the economy in Italy was not good and it was hard to get work. My great grandfather heard that America was a growing country and came to find work. About a year later, my great grandfather enlisted in the army. My grandfather was drafted into World War II. Don't think he was 100 years old, because this was the end of the war. He is still alive. He has gone through a lot. When he got older, he was a construction worker. Then he worked for the statehouse, fixing it and getting rid of rats. He met my grandmother and had three kids - one was my dad. <br> <br>Now you know about the Bianchi family. I look up to my father, my grandfather, and my great grandfather. They've accomplished a lot living here.</i></p>

  <p>This map shows, in extraordinary detail, the roads, waterways, cities, towns, and topography of mid-19th-century Italy. Just north of the Sicilian island of Pantellaria, a tiny and brief note mentions the mysterious volcanic island of Ferdinandea (a.k.a. Graham Island) that rose out of the sea in 1831 only to sink again a few months later. When the island emerged from the ocean, it was immediately claimed by the Italian and British governments each of whom, in turn, gave it a name. Recent seismic activity in Sicily has prompted speculation that the island may soon rise again, reviving the old territorial dispute.</p>

  <p>The mid-19th century was a time of immense change in Florence and throughout Tuscany. This map was produced at the very end of the reign of the Dukes of Tuscany over the city of Florence. The splendor of the duchy is much in evidence here -- from the huge palace and extensive gardens of the Pitti Palace in the north to the imposing fortress of the Castello San Giovan Battista at the south. It was, in part, this very splendor and extravagance that inspired the brief popular revolution in 1849 in the wake of similar uprisings in France. Although many of the streets on this map are still found in today's Florence, the modern city extends far beyond the boundaries outlined here</p>

There was in fact a neurological disorder once prevalent in this part of Italy called "tarantism," which induced in the sufferer a kind of hysteria, including a sudden inclination to dance and spin -- the perspiration of dancing helped the body to heal itself. It was commonly thought, as expressed on this map, that the illness itself was brought on by the bite of the tarantula and that the dance was the cure. The Italian folkdance, the tarantella, originates from this folktale.</p>

My mother and her older sister moved to America in 1987, the same year I was born. In 1990, I moved to America to be with them. My family moved from Jamaica because in Jamaica, it is very hard to make a living. You can't make very much money and everybody puts you down. Life in Boston is different from life in my country, because no matter how hard you try to be successful in Jamaica, it will feel like you are going nowhere, like a big circle. My family moved to America to let all the hardship lift off their backs. </i><i>We originated from Portmore, Jamaica, the most beautiful place I have ever been. It is because of its beauty that even though life in Jamaica is harder than it is here, it will always be my country. But beauty is not its only draw. I also love Jamaica because of the large amount of creativity and color you find there. Jamaicans are creative. </i><i>They take music from other cultures, like the song by R. Kelly, "The Greatest," and create their own sound and make it their own. Also, they are amazing story-tellers. Some stories told in America come from the Jamaican culture; like "Itsy-Bitsy Spider" emerged from the Jamaican story "Nancy the Spider." And the national colors are symbolized in the dress and how people act. No one in Jamaica is ever dull. They are always bright and stand out. Another great aspect of Jamaica is its prime minister. I feel that the American president could learn a great deal from the Jamaican prime minister. His name is James Patterson, and he is a wonderful role model. He treats every one with respect. Also, he moves around and gets involved with the community. And he cares about the safety of the people on his island. I feel our president should be more involved with the communities in America. The Jamaican prime minister represents the heart of Jamaica. </i><i>In conclusion, Jamaica will always be my country, because I love its beauty, its creativity, its color, and its heart. Even though it's harder </i><i>to live in Jamaica than here, I will always miss it.</i></p>

  <p>The early 1990s saw a wave of immigration from Caribbean countries, including Haiti. After the ousting in 1991 of Haiti's first democratically-elected president, Jean Betrand Aristide, the United States and the United Nations imposed trade and oil embargoes on the country in an effort to remove its military leadership. As the military controllers resisted international pressure, the embargoes become harsher. The combination of economic ruin and civil disorder created a situation where many people fled the country. Even after a 1994 amnesty returned Aristide to power, Haitians continued to immigrate to the United States due to ongoing political turmoil and a weakened economy.</p>

  <p>Besides geographically sharing the same island as neighboring Haiti, the Dominican Republic shares many of the political and economic woes of its sister country. During the 1960s and 1970s, a continuous cloud of political uncertainty spread throughout the country, highlighted by a civil war in 1965. the government stabilized somewhat in the early 1970s, but remained fragile. As in most cases, political trouble leads to economic hardship. The Dominican Republic was no exception. At the end of the 20th century, the political and economic situation in the country began to improve significantly. However, by then many Dominicans had immigrated to the United States and the Boston area to escape decades of turmoil.</p>

In October 1999, my sisters came home with a math assignment which they didn't understand. They asked me if I could help them, and I said "no", but then I saw they were having a hard time which made me feel bad so I decided to help them.

  <p>Using the latest advances in modern technology for gathering depth soundings and generating automated cartography, this chart was prepared primarily for navigational purposes, testifying to sailors' continual quest for obtaining the most reliable information since the 16th century for navigating the treacherous waters of the Caribbean.

The insets of Havana and the Philippines may seem out of place, but are in fact quite timely; in May 1898, the United States was simultaneously sending troops to the Philippines and preparing for war with Cuba, both under Spanish control. With the United States undertaking territorial expansion in several parts of the world in 1898, this map would have been an indispensable guide for the American public to keep track of international developments. </p>

</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>This late-18th-century map, which was based on earlier works by the French royal geographer, Robert de Vaugondy, depicts the West Indies, the chain of islands enclosing the Caribbean Sea. Stretching in an arc from southern Florida to the northern coast of South America, these islands have been divided into three groupings by geographers -- the Bahamas (Lucayas), low lying islands east of Florida; the Greater Antilles, including the large mountainous islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico; and the Lesser Antilles or Caribbees, small volcanic islands bordering the Caribbean Sea on the east. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>In comparison to the rest of the Americas, the West Indies were not large in territory, but they were some of Europe's most prized possessions during the 18th century, primarily because of their ability to produce sugar and other tropical plantation crops. In the context of these intense political and commercial rivalries, Robert du Vaugondy placed the most prosperous French colony of Saint Domingue (Hispaniola) in the center of the map. He also identified the small islands in the Lesser Antilles with the letters "F", "A", and "D" to indicate French, English, or Danish control.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Although the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola was officially drawn two years before this map was published, the map shows no such national boundary. This is almost certainly due to the fact that this map comes from an Italian reprint of Robert de Vaugondy’s Atlas Universel, first published in 1750-57, before the border existed. </p>

  <p>The political situation on the islands of Jamaica and Hispaniola during this time period is evident here. By the end of the 18th century, British colonialism had imposed on Jamaica rather ill-fitting and contrived English-style counties with names such as Middlesex and Surry, names that are still used today. On Hispaniola, meanwhile, the Treaty of 1777 had given birth to the border between present-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic. This separation is clearly delineated on this map.</p>

  <p>In this composite map of five West Indian islands, separate maps of Cuba and Hispaniola are flanked on the left by insets of Jamaica, Puerto Rico (here called the island of St. John), St. Margaret (north of Puerto Rico), and the port of Havana at the upper right. These early maps of Cuba and Hispaniola are covered with indigenous Taino place names. In addition to the Spanish name, the native names of Haity and Quisqueia are used for Hispaniola, and Taino place names such as Xaragua and Yaguana are used alongside Spanish names.</p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Eventually, the Taino settlements disappeared and their names were permanently replaced by Spanish and French names. This map is found in the 1630 Dutch edition of the Mercator and Hondius Atlas Minor issued by Jan Jansson. First published in 1607, this small-format atlas was based on Mercator’s larger folio atlas, entitled simply “Atlas” originally published in 1595. This was the first time that the title “Atlas” was applied to a book of maps. </p>

</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Although no border between French and Spanish territory is indicated on this map (no official border existed until 1777), the uneasy sharing of the island of Hispaniola, or Santo Domingo, by the French and the Spanish colonial governments is evident in the island's place names. In the east, today's Dominican Republic, French names are used for coastal features, while the Spanish names used today are given for towns and churches. In the west, only French names are used. By the time this map was printed, the Spanish had ceded the western third of the island to the French. Spain would soon regret the concession, since what would later be known as Haiti was showing great promise in the sugar trade. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>This topographical map of Santo Domingo features mountains and rivers in addition to coastal features and towns. It was published in volume 15 of A. F. Prevost's Histoires Generale des Voyages. Longitude is measured west from Paris, and the scale is given in standard French units. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Since this map was engraved during a period of strong colonialism on the island, and the original inhabitants were nearly extinct due to war and disease, there is little sign of the original Taino place names -- one remaining example is the Yaqui River near the center of the island. </p>

  <p>This combination map of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Hispaniola was published in the 1817 edition of Thomson's New General Atlas.

These maps are primarily topographical, recording very few human settlements, but mountains, rivers, inlets, bays, capes, and other coastal features are recorded in detail.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1494, Jamaica was a Spanish colony until 1655 when it was taken over by the British. The third largest island in the West Indies, it became the focus of British activity in the Caribbean. Its economy was dominated by sugar production based on the slave labor that was imported from Africa. Details on this 1775 map by the British geographer and publisher Thomas Jeffreys record the racial segregation that was institutionalized during the British colonial regime. Underlining distinguishes what are referred to on the map as "Negro-towns," most of which are situated in the less hospitable mountainous interior. In contrast, the flatter coastal areas, which were more suitable for agriculture, are dotted with small squares and circles, symbolizing the British-owned sugar plantations and sugar mills. In addition, the map's two insets depict the topography and hydrography of the island's busiest ports, Kingston and Bluefields, which had become centers of British colonial administrative and mercantile activities. </p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Published by the U.S. Department of Defense, the map series of which this modern map of Jamaica and Haiti is part, had its origins in an ambitious international project, known as the “Millionth Map” or the International Map of the World. The idea, conceived by German geographer Albrecht Penck, was to create a series of 2,500 topographic map sheets that would cover the planet, all in the same scale of 1 centimeter equals 10 kilometers (or 1:1,000,000). </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>In 1913, an international conference established standards and practices for the project, giving each participating country responsibility for creating its own maps. Although the project was eventually taken over by the United Nations, funding and international enthusiasm soon waned. After World War II, several countries (including the United States and the United Kingdom) published their own world map series at a scale of 1:1,000,000. </p>
