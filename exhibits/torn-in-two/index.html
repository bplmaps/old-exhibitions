        <p>The Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, is the centerpiece of our nation's story. It looms large, not merely because of its brutality and scope but because of its place in the course of American history. The seeds of war were planted long before 1861 and the conflict remains part of our national memory.</p><p>Geography has helped shape this narrative. The physical landscape influenced economic differences between the regions, the desire to expand into new territories, the execution of the conflict both in the field and on the home front, and the ways in which our recollections have been shaped.</p><p>Maps enable us to present the complex strands that, when woven together, provide a detailed account of the causes and conduct of the war. These visual images remain a salient aspect of our memory. Photographs, prints, diaries, songs and letters enhance our ability to tell this story, when our nation, as a Currier &amp; Ives cartoon depicts, was about to be "Torn in Two."</p><p>This exhibition tells the story of the American Civil War both nationally and locally in Boston, Massachusetts, through maps, documents, letters, and other primary sources.</p>

  <h3>1. Before the War: Rising Tensions</h3>
  <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Most timelines of the Civil War begin in April 1861 with the firing on Fort Sumter, a federal facility in South Carolina which had seceded five months earlier. Those shots were the technical start of the war but the underlying causes had been present for decades. Diversity had been the hallmark of the disparate 13 colonies, but becoming a nation took more than merely declaring independence. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>These fledglings shared a common purpose, to be different from Europe. Here hard work would result in the virtue and dignity necessary to participate in a republic. Yet the differences did not ebb as the founders had hoped, nor could compromise and political balance serve as a safeguard against increasing differences of economics, politics and moral sensibilities as the nation expanded physically and demographically. </p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Each side, South and North, slave and free, believed that it was the legitimate heir to fulfill the nation’s destiny but they became so incompatible that the differences threatened to truly “tear the nation in two”.</p>

          <p>I do not know why God in His wisdom has chosen the lot of women to be so oppressed. Now that Father has died, my elder sister Lucy’s husband controls our fortunes. He is a man of no knowledge and even less intelligence and I fear that he will leave us in ruin. Mother is too stricken with grief to be of influence. What will befall us? There are no professions for us to enter. The few places for women tarnish our reputation so deeply as to be impossible. If we teach, we are considered ill-bred. Will I be reduced to that? Is my education to mean nothing? Our friend Louisa May Alcott makes money sometimes from her stories but I have not that talent.</p>

          <p>I can’t stand this talk of war, but only because I am too old to volunteer. I will fight to the death to protect my land, where my family has lived for 75 years. It is the most beautiful piece of God’s earth in Louisiana. There is no need for war if the North would stop their hypocrisy, lies and judgment of a world they know nothing of. They accuse us of being slave-mongering demons, yet they trap factory workers in a life of debt that never ends. Their workers have no freedom, and my slaves are better treated than any factory girl of theirs. My workers are fed well and kept healthy, while theirs starve and freeze to an early death from their working conditions. And if we have not the right to govern ourselves, they want us to throw away the Constitution of these very United States. We have no reason to be united with them any longer and would be well rid of them.</p>

They gave us flintlock muskets! We may as well be fighting the Mexican War, if it took place in 1800! When we saw that there were no bullets they gave us blocks of lead that we are supposed to melt down and make our own bullets from. No surprise that we lost our first battle at New Berne. Our next battle was even worse because we had new rifles, but we were cut off from the other regiments and most of us captured. I lay exhausted in the bushes and to my shame they sent out wagons to pick up soldiers like me.</p>

          <p>Last night Pa left the dinner table early. Usually we all sit around and Pa talks about politics here in New York and across the country. Ma wants him to stop because she doesn’t want any of us children getting involved in any of the hot issues that are flying around us. She once threatened to stop making pie at all if it was going to encourage us all to stay at the table. I ran upstairs, saying I had studying, but really to watch where Pa went. I noticed he took a lantern with him into the barn and I saw little twinkles of light moving toward our barn. I couldn’t help it – I wriggled my way through the window in my room, climbed down the pear tree and ran to the loose board in the barn. I ran back soon because what I heard scared me so much. Pa was becoming a Copperhead. Some people call them “peace Democrats” because they are against the war that everyone says will happen soon. But lots of people call them traitors.</p>

To my shock, it was Father, standing by the stairs surrounded by his tools. He told me sternly to go back to bed.

          <p>My name is Annie Sullivan and I’m one of the people they call a mill girl in Lowell, Massachusetts. I guess the girls here all used to be Yankee girls, but when the Famine happened my family and a lot of others came here looking for work so a lot of us are Irish now. It’s so different from places in Europe where mill girls are beaten and paid almost nothing. At least that’s what they say. It’s true we have to work 11 hours, but the old girls had to work 12. We make twice as much as we could as servants or seamstresses and I am putting a bit of savings aside from what I send home. My parents don’t know. I told them there was a rent increase for our boarding but there really wasn’t. God forgive me! Anyway, now they say war is coming and I’m very scared.</p>

  <p>By 1861, life was very different north and south of the Mason Dixon line. Although neither was monolithic, industry, reliable transportation and a wage labor force prevailed in the North. Agriculture dominated the South where limited transportation and few urban areas were not a problem for the realm where cotton was ‘king’. Moral superiority and political expediency were heaped on these economic differences, each side drawing on those aspects of the American ideal that most suited its needs.</p>

In 25 years the city grew exponentially, and by 1850 had a population of 30,000, making it the nation’s largest industrial community. Thirteen textile mills, depicted in the marginal illustrations, provided the focus of this industrial activity. <br> <br>Paradoxically, the raw material supplying Lowell’s factories, creating its wealth, was cotton from the American South. The factories first employed local single women, but eventually they were replaced by Irish immigrants in the 1830s and 1840s. <br></p>

  <p>During the antebellum period, cotton was considered “king“ in the South, as it was the region’s predominant cash crop. Cotton cultivation began in coastal South Carolina, but with the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, spread rapidly as far west as Texas. <br> <br>Requiring fertile soil and an extensive growing season, there was a northern geographic limit to cotton cultivation. This boundary is suggested by the “mean summer temperature“ line on this detailed statistical map delineating the major areas of cotton production. <br> <br>Published by Brookline resident Edward Atkinson, this map was one of many documents about cotton that he authored. An executive officer for a number of Boston area textile factories, Atkinson was also an ardent abolitionist and wrote numerous tracts advocating cotton cultivation with free labor.</p>

Attesting to this map’s importance to Abraham Lincoln, it was deliberately depicted in Francis Bicknell Carpenter’s oil painting, First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln. The artist’s memoir records Lincoln’s fascination with the map, not just for its symbolic power, but because it allowed him to follow and plan military movements, and to relate those actions to his emancipation policies.</p>

  <p>Concord, Massachusetts, which is widely recognized for its role in the American Revolution and the literary and philosophical “revolution“ of Transcendentalism, was also a center of anti-slavery activity. Among those residents who supported the anti-slavery cause were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau. <br> <br>This 1852 landownership map of Concord portrays the community a decade before the Civil War. The site of the first battle of the American Revolution is marked with a monument labeled “Birthplace of American Liberty.“ <br> <br>It is also possible to locate the homes of a number of those involved in the anti-slavery movement. Emerson's and Hawthorne's homes are near the village center. Others include Mary Rice, a station master on the Underground Railroad, and Peter Hutchinson, a free black man.</p>

  <p>Because the Underground Railroad was based on the combined efforts of many sympathetic people working secretly to assist slaves in moving toward freedom, there were no contemporary maps to guide those who escaped or that depict the full extent of this complex communication network. However, historians have been able to document “stations“ or places that assisted runaway slaves and the major routes that they traveled, based on oral histories gathered from slaves who reached freedom. <br> <br>One of the primary efforts to “map“ the Underground Railroad is a manuscript map based on slave narratives collected and recorded by the Federal Writers Project during the 1930s. Displayed here is a detail from that map illustrating the New England area. </p>

  <p>This modern reconstruction presents a comprehensive depiction of documented routes, stations, and destinations on the Underground Railroad. It is apparent that there were many journeys generally in a south to north direction, both by land and sea. Although the routes traversed all the states north of the Ohio River and the Mason-Dixon Line, there was a heavy concentration in the Mid-Atlantic and New England states. <br> <br>By closely examining both of these maps, it is evident that there were a number of “stations“ in the Boston area, including such recorded stations as the William Jackson House in Newton, the William Lloyd Garrison House in Roxbury, the William Ingersoll Bowditch House in Brookline, and the Lewis and Harriet Hayden House on Boston's Beacon Hill. </p>

  <p>Besides escaping to the North, another alternative for freed slaves was “colonization“ or resettlement in Africa.

The Society established the colony of Liberia, named from the Latin word for “free,“ on the west coast of Africa as a homeland for former slaves from the United States. <br> <br>An 1845 map of Liberia published by the Society shows that many place names were of African origin. However, several reflect a strong American influence, as does Monrovia, named for President James Monroe.</p>

Eventually, Boston sympathizers purchased his freedom. <br> <br>The case stirred passions among those who had been indifferent. While the ultimate statement of slaves as property would come with the 1857 Dred Scott decision, the Burns case was one more step on the road to disunion. </p>

  <p>While the war would pit North against South, it was the West that became untenable. Physical expansion marked the country’s first decades and the extension to the Pacific by mid-19th century represented more than just economic gain. It was the nation’s Manifest Destiny to spread, but which vision would hold in these new territories? Before they took to arms, Americans battled in the courts, state houses, Congress, and individual states. The election of Lincoln in 1860 led the Southern states to believe that secession was their only option.</p>

  <p>Published as a campaign poster supporting the Republican Party's first presidential bid in 1856, this broadside provides a commentary on the geographical sectionalism that was polarizing the nation. Using 1850 census data, it tabulated the demographic and economic differences between free and slave states, highlighting political concerns that the balance of Congressional power would shift as newly acquired western territories were admitted as states into the Union. The map clearly marked the 1820 Missouri Compromise line, which had defined the boundary between free and slave states. However, the passage of the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act nullified this long-standing compromise line, and potentially opened the entire western territory to slavery because it sanctioned “popular sovereignty“ whereby citizens of each territory could vote on the slavery issue.</p>

  <p>Sectional interest in controlling the West was particularly evident in the Pacific Railroad Surveys, conducted from 1853-54 under the direction of then Secretary of War, Jefferson Davis. Four east-west traverses, designed to satisfy both northern and southern sectional interests, were surveyed in order to determine the most practical route for the first trans-continental railroad. The potential routes were delineated on a “hurried“ map prepared by Lt. G.K. Warren in 1855, shortly after the surveys were completed. Although none of the four routes was selected in its entirety, the first trans-continental railroad followed a mid-continental route connecting Omaha and San Francisco. Begun during the war, this rail line was not completed until 1869, four years after the war ended.</p>

  <p>The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 established two new territories with a provision that settlers would decide whether they entered the Union as free or slave states. This legislation negated the 1820 Missouri Compromise which previously designated Missouri’s southern boundary as the dividing line between free and slave states. As eastern Kansas was settled during the 1850s, intense competition and armed conflict developed between pro-slavery and anti-slavery (Free State) factions, and the territory came to be known as “Bloody Kansas.“ Pro-slavery settlers moved from neighboring Missouri which permitted slavery, while groups such as the New England Emigrant Aid Company promoted anti-slavery settlement. </p>

  <p>Congressional reaction to the Bloody Kansas situation is captured in this shocking and unsettling image by Winslow Homer. It evokes the rising tensions among abolitionists and slave owners in the years preceding the Civil War. The cartoon depicts an infuriated Preston Brooks, Representative from South Carolina, beating Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner with a cane on the floor of Congress. The beating was in retaliation for Sumner’s anti-slavery speech “Crime against Kansas“ delivered May 19-20, 1856. The sarcastic use of the word “chivalry“ in the cartoon’s title expresses northern views that the graceful and refined manners of southern gentlemen were disingenuous, considering many owned slaves. With this violent assault, Brooks succeeded in positioning Sumner as a martyr for the anti-slavery cause. </p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>As sectional tensions increased during the late 1850s, there was rising sentiment among the southern states advocating secession. However, the spark that ignited the secessionist movement was Republican Abraham Lincoln’s victory in the Presidential 1860 election. Fearing the loss of their rights as slaveholders, seven states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America with Jefferson Davis as President. <br> <br>Originally published in 1859, this rare railroad map was overprinted to show the first states to secede. The initial boundary of the Confederacy is marked by a heavy red line. Also depicted is the first flag of the Confederate States of America, the Stars and Bars. It was placed over the state of Alabama, signifying Montgomery as the first capital of the Confederacy. <br></p>

  <h3>2. During the War: A Nation in Conflict</h3>
  <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The Civil War was unlike any other in US history. Fought completely on America soil, armies were most successful when they had accurate knowledge of the terrain. The South troops had an early advantage, not only because they had superior military leaders, but because most of the battles occurred on their home territory. Thus, they needed to wage a defensive campaign only. Reliable cartographic information was limited or absent and severely hindered the Northern efforts, often resulting in high casualties.<br><br>The war was all encompassing and every American had a personal stake in its course. Soldiers were recruited, supplied, trained, and transported. Casualties were high and many civilians came forward to care for the wounded. Those on the home front raised money, provided comfort and longed for news of their loved ones. Advances in technology, communication and transportation brought this information to them quickly and graphically. Visual images such as maps, photographs, cartoons and prints told the story as it unfolded. Traditional means such as letters, diaries and sketches also provided detailed accounts of the conflict.</p>

I am lucky to be taken! Activist Dorothea Dix’s recruits are required to be middle-aged and plain, but Louisa vouched for me. I had to grow used to death and violence with no delay, and I will never remove the stains of gore on my apron. The wounded’s agony broke my heart and called me to give my best. Whether I write letters for them or hold a hand until the last breath of life, I know I am doing God’s work and serving my country. There are thousands of us nurses – surely this will bring change to our world after the war!</p>

Ma insisted that we boys be sent to Toronto where we could get work on farms until the war ended. Ma is Irish from way back. She told us about the times when the English sold Irish people as slaves to the Caribbean. Half a million of them. They were much cheaper than African slaves, who cost five times as much. She didn’t trust any one of English descent who was going to send the Irish to war. “We’ll be cannon fodder,“ she said. Copperhead newspapers cried for an end to war, a Union with slavery, and deposing Lincoln. They encouraged Union deserters and even had contacts with Confederate Army units.</p>

  <h3>2A. Geography of War</h3>
  <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Terrain influenced strategies and often determined outcome. Knowledge of the landscape meant victory or defeat. There were few large-scale topographic maps of the theaters of war available to military strategists prior to engagement. These factors gave military leadership in the South an initial advantage, but the North created broad geographical strategies that would use its economic strengths, particularly the disruption of trade which included naval blockades, control of the Mississippi River, and destruction of supply routes. Both sides were determined to capture each other’s capital. Although Washington, DC, was threatened several times, the Confederate capital of Richmond remained an elusive goal until the war’s end.</p>

Washington, DC, was situated precariously on the Potomac River, sandwiched between Maryland, a slave state which did not secede, and Virginia, one of the last slave states to secede. As a primary defense, Union troops constructed an extensive ring of earthen forts around the city. <br> <br>Richmond, which became the Confederate capital in mid-1861, was situated less than 100 miles south of Washington, DC. Confederate troops also fortified Richmond with a ring of forts, as depicted on this map published in Boston. As a reminder to a northern audience that Richmond was the target, the publisher placed a series of concentric rings around the city. </p>

  <p>In this political cartoon published by Currier &amp; Ives, Gen. Winfield Scott, the first commander of the Union armies, is depicted as a fierce bulldog fronting the might of the North. <br> <br>Supported by supplies, munitions and financial resources, he taunts the sheepish greyhound “Jeff.“ A great juicy bone labeled “Washington Prize Beef“ rests between them, and Scott asks “Why don’t you take it?“ as the Confederate leader slips away with his tail between his legs toward his meager supply of cotton. The cartoon suggests that the South had cotton but not many other resources, and did not have the means to seize the bone, or the capital city of Washington. </p>

  <p>In pursuing Scott’s broad geographic objectives, Union armies made substantial progress in blockading the southeastern coastline and occupying the Mississippi River. This tactic created an economic hardship by greatly diminishing commerce with Europe. With control of the Mississippi Valley, they split the Confederacy, cutting off supply routes particularly from Texas and Arkansas. In order to demonstrate the progress of this strategy, the U.S. Coast Survey published at least seven maps with the same title, “Historical Sketch of the Rebellion,“ each delineating Union military progress. By early 1864, the North had gained control of the entire Mississippi River Valley, blocked most southern ports, and had occupied much of the Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia coastal areas.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>In the spring of 1861, when war was inevitable, Union Army General-in-Chief Winfield Scott devised a long-term strategy to economically and militarily crush the Confederacy. The plan called for a naval blockade of southern ports and a major offensive down the Mississippi River, thereby cutting off supply routes and dividing the South. Scott’s tactic was dubbed the “Anaconda Plan,“ as it was intended to constrict the insurgent States, as would a snake. The plan was depicted graphically in this 1861 pictorial map. Although not prevalent during the Civil War, propaganda maps such as this were designed to have maximum emotional effect on the user, as more civilians became aware of wartime activities.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the war, few detailed topographic maps were available to officers for planning movements and engagements. In addition, some moderate-scale state maps, which could be used for planning broader regional strategies, were out-of-date. This was especially true for Virginia, where many of the battles were fought. Although this 1861 Virginia map claims to be official, accurate and current, the title is misleading. It was not an official state publication; rather it was produced by a commercial firm located in New York City. It was derived from an 1859 state map, which was a hurried revision of an earlier 1828 state map. The latter map did incorporate county surveys, but they were inconsistent in scale and data collected. </p>

  <p>Anticipating war, the U.S. Coast Survey was one of the few agencies able to provide accurate nautical charts and topographic maps before and during the war. Led by Alexander Dallas Bache, the nation’s foremost scientist and great-grandson of Benjamin Franklin, the agency’s primary mission was to chart the nation’s coastal waters, and by the 1850s was beginning to produce detailed nautical charts for most of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal waters. One example is this chart of South Carolina’s Charleston Harbor published in 1863. Utilizing an 1858 chart, which was based on detailed hydrographic and topographic surveys conducted in the early 1850s, this version was overprinted to show forts, “National“ and “Rebel“ trenches and batteries, and positions of the attacking fleet as of September 7, 1863.</p>

The press told this story with words and images by publishing cartoons, photographs and sketches. Theater of war and battle maps allowed viewers to follow troop progress. Personal communication, such as telegrams, soldiers’ letters, and diaries, brought poignant accounts of war.</p>

  <p>During the Civil War, more than 2,000 maps appeared in Northern daily newspapers. In contrast to previous journalistic practices, this production represented a remarkable increase in number and variety. Prior to the war, maps rarely appeared in American newspapers, and those that did tended to be small and diagrammatic. The expansion of railroad and telegraph networks and advances in printing technologies during the 1850s facilitated this revolution in journalistic cartography.<br><br>To broaden their coverage of the war, newspapers greatly expanded their press corps by adding correspondents to their payrolls. Consequently, an important component of army camps was the press, or as Harper’s Weekly referred to them, the “newspaper brigade.” In Thomas Nast’s 1864 engraving for the magazine, correspondents were depicted in numerous vignettes obtaining news from contrabands, embedded with soldiers on the field, and skeptically listening to "reliable information." For those reading Harper's Weekly back home, this view depicts the journalist’s life at the front, and overall is a comprehensive representation of how the popular media covered the war.</p>

The supplement’s front page displays a general reference map highlighting the naval blockade of the southeastern coast, while the opposing page presents two more detailed maps depicting New Orleans and the Lower Potomac.

  <p>This schematic map illustrates the nature of newspaper maps and their role in helping to inform the public of the progress of the war. Published on the front page of The New York Times ten days after the battle, it accompanied an extensive article about the Battle of Balls Bluff, which occurred on the banks of the Potomac River a few miles west of Washington, DC. What was supposed to be a diversionary maneuver while a larger Union force moved against Confederate troops encamped near Leesburg, Virginia, resulted in a disastrous retreat for Union troops, including both the Massachusetts 15th and 20th Regiments. The lack of good topographic information, which is almost totally lacking in this quickly prepared diagram, contributed to their defeat.</p>

  <p>The first major battle fought on northern soil occurred September 17, 1862, in Washington County, Maryland, about 50 miles west of Washington, DC. Known as Antietam Creek or Sharpsburg, it is now recognized as the bloodiest one-day battle in American history, with approximately 23,000 casualties. <br> <br>Accounts of this battle started to appear in northern newspapers two to three days after the engagement. One of the earliest map-illustrated articles was published in the New York Tribune, September 19. Although this map did not attempt to depict the military action of the day, it did show the general location of Sharpsburg and the surrounding countryside along the upper Potomac River. The Tribune published a more detailed map of the battlefield in the next day’s issue. </p>

  <p>The first major battle of the war occurred July 21, 1861, near Manassas, Virginia, an important railroad junction approximately 25 miles west of Washington, DC. This map, published in Richmond, is one of only a few examples of battle maps produced by a commercial publisher within the Confederacy. This relatively simple diagram used pictorial symbols and text to provide a detailed account of the battle. As indicated in the map’s title, the battle was known by various names. The Confederates, who named battles for nearby towns, knew it as the Battle of Manassas. For the Union army, which often named battles for nearby rivers or streams, it was the Battle of Bull Run. </p>

  <p>This map, prepared by a Union artillery officer, focuses less on the battle action, but demonstrates its strategic significance in relation to Washington, DC. Charged with defending the nation’s capital, Union troops hoped to gain a quick victory over Confederate troops. <br> <br>Anticipating that a Union victory would bring a speedy end to the war, citizens from the nation’s capital came in carriages with picnic lunches to watch the action. Unfortunately, the poorly trained Union troops suffered a humiliating defeat, and both sides realized that the war would not be resolved quickly. <br> <br>Other names used for the battle, as reflected in the map’s title, were Stone Bridge and Manassas Plains. Another battle occurred in the same area, August 29-30, 1862, and subsequently was known as the Second Battle of Bull Run or Manassas.</p>

  <p>The Confederate bombardment and Union surrender of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, April 12-13, 1861, marked the beginning of the Civil War. Since the city remained under Confederate control throughout the war, it continued to be an objective of Union military strategy. <br> <br>Appealing to a northern audience following the Union army’s attempts to regain South Carolina’s primary port, Boston publisher Louis Prang issued four undated variations of this map. Each focused on Fort Sumter, surrounded by concentric circles at half-mile intervals, as if marking it a target for Union aggression. Published in 1863, this version documented Union operations from April to September, which included the heroic but disastrous assault on Fort Wagner by the Massachusetts 54th, the African-American regiment led by Robert Shaw, on July 18. </p>

  <p>In addition to newspaper maps, commercially published battle maps were available to folks on the home front for following the progress of the war. A number of such maps were published by Boston firms. For example, Boston publisher G.W. Tomlinson issued a map of Petersburg, Virginia, near the end of the war. Using a concentric ring overlay, it depicted the Union siege under the command of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, of this vital railroad center approximately 20 miles south of Richmond. The map clearly delineated the elaborate trench network that both sides constructed during the campaign. The assault began in June 1864 and lasted for ten months, the longest sustained operation of the war.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>The production of music scores quickly shifted to wartime needs after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter. Composers rapidly produced “Songs of War,“ as suggested by this Winslow Homer illustration published in <i>Harper’s Weekly</i>. The image displays seven wartime songs, but it is dominated by a vignette depicting a multitude of soldiers marching to war and singing the chorus “Glory Hallelujah.“ Religious fervor was common in 19th century discourse. As the country divided, the rhetoric reflected the passion on both sides. The Battle Hymn of the Republic is a strong example of the juxtaposition of militancy and religion. Although a seeming departure from the pacifist Protestant reform spirit of the 1830s and 1840s, clergy on both sides exhorted troops to show no mercy on their enemy as they sought justice.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Julia Ward Howe’s Battle Hymn of the Republic, written as an abolitionist poem, became very popular during the Civil War. After visiting a Union army camp near Washington, DC, in 1861, she was inspired by soldiers singing lyrics to a camp song that originated as a parody of John Brown, a soldier at Boston’s Fort Warren and John Brown, the abolitionist. Howe’s poem, which easily fit the same tune, was first published in The Atlantic Monthly in February 1862. Displayed here are the original lyrics that she recopied in 1901. <br> <br>Along with her husband Samuel Gridley Howe, Julia Ward was active in the anti-slavery movement. Together they edited the abolitionist newspaper, The Commonwealth. Her husband was the director of the Perkins Institute for the Blind, then located in South Boston. <br></p>

  <p>Printed sheet music increased in popularity during the middle of the 19th century as printing technologies improved and music playing in middle class homes became a fashionable pastime. Musical compositions relating to the Civil War, as illustrated by examples of sheet music published in Boston, highlighted the accomplishments of individuals such as Massachusetts-born Gen. Joseph Hooker, individual regiments including the Massachusetts 44th, and military campaigns, notably the Battle of the Wilderness. Decorative covers were added to the printed scores to adorn and advertise the lyrics. These war-time covers, which display powerful visual images, convey the glory and struggle of the conflict. They reminded those on the home front of the soldiers’ affections, the causes for which they fought, and the ne’er do wells they opposed. <br></p>

  <p>Invaluable insights about military life and detailed eyewitness accounts of individual battles can be gleaned from letters that soldiers sent to loved ones at home, such as those written by Boston resident Henry Ropes. He wrote extensive letters to his father and brother, often three and four pages in length. Occasionally he drew rough sketch maps to illustrate individual battles, including one of Fredericksburg, Virginia. <br> <br>Ropes’ last letter was dated June 27, 1863, as his unit was marching toward Gettysburg. There are no more letters, since he was fatally wounded by friendly fire on the morning of the third day of the battle. The last item in the volume is a rough sketch map prepared in October 1863 by his brother John, noting “H.R. died here.“ </p>

</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Among the true treasures of the Boston Public Library is an oil painting by artist Winslow Homer, entitled Officers at Camp Benton, Maryland, 1861. Commissioned twenty years after the event, it portrays Capt. William Bartlett and Lt. Col. Francis W. Palfrey of the 20th Massachusetts Volunteers at their camp near Poolesville, Maryland. Painted mostly from photographs at the request of a retired Colonel Palfrey, the image resembles an 1862 photograph, uniquely framed with epaulettes from his uniform. The photograph, which shows Palfrey and several other officers standing near a cabin at Antietam, may have served as the basis for this canvas. Although not executed while Homer was in situ as artist-correspondent, the subjects exhibit the same qualities of introspection and longing that are found in many of his wartime compositions. <br></p>

  <p>A photograph, framed with epaulets, of officers standing in front of a cabin at Antietam, his sword, and a prayer book are several of the more unusual items found among the Civil War related artifacts and books saved and collected by Col.

  <p>Among the most unique and interesting Civil War maps are relatively unknown manuscript maps drawn by individual soldiers during the war. Intended for a very limited and personal audience, such maps can be discovered in a variety of media, including daily journals and letters. For example, Joseph Dean with the 44th Massachusetts Regiment sent several letters to his mother in Boston. These letters, dated 1862 and 1863, were sent from Camp Stevenson near New Bern, North Carolina, where the regiment was stationed. Among the rough sketch maps that he drew is one showing the location of New Bern at the juncture of the Trent and Neuse Rivers. The town fell to Union forces March 14, 1862, and remained under Union control until the end of the war.</p>

Through letters, gifts, and visits, wounded soldiers knew that those back home were doing everything possible to assist the Union cause.</p>

  <p>A crucial activity was the recruitment of young men to serve as soldiers. In 1862, President Lincoln called for 300,000 new volunteers to serve for three years; within a month he made another request for 300,000 more men to serve for nine months. Consequently, the recruiting committees were hard at work, as depicted in an 1862 print showing a recruiting station on Flag Staff Hill in Boston Common<i>. </i> In this illustration, Union soldiers converse with potential recruits as part of an extensive grass-roots recruiting effort. Massachusetts heard the President’s call and filled its quota. A monument dedicated to the soldiers and sailors of Massachusetts who perished in the Civil War now stands at this same site on the Boston Common.</p>

These Roxbury ladies presented their creation with great ceremony and fanfare to the city’s first company of volunteers in April 1861. Their presentation was recorded in the Roxbury City Gazette, which included the Mayor’s introductory remarks: “We are assembled on an interesting occasion to witness the presentation by the young ladies of Roxbury, of a banner to a company of our brave citizens about to step forward manfully in defense of the noblest government ever devised by human wisdom, and which is now endangered by the acts of rebels and traitors.“ </p>

One of these units was the Massachusetts 54th led by Col. Robert Shaw, the first black regiment enlisted by any state during the war. The camp is illustrated with a ground plan prepared during the war showing the location of barracks, cook houses, and stables. It was named for Gen. Montgomery C.

  <p>The forts that had been constructed during the first half of the 19th century on various islands as part of the Boston Harbor defenses were also mobilized for the war effort. One example is Fort Warren, which was strategically located on Georges Island. Constructed in 1833, this massive pentagonal fortification served as a prison for Confederate leaders and officers. More than 2,200 prisoners were incarcerated in the fort during the conflict. It was also used to train new infantry recruits. An 1861 engraving from Harper’s Weekly provides a view of the fort from the harbor, as well as an interior view with soldiers performing exercises.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>How we choose to tell the story of the war that almost dissolved our nation suggests its magnitude, importance and centrality in our collective and individual memories. Visual images comprise an important part of this narrative. As technology improved during the second half of the 19th century, the ability to create and disseminate memorable images expanded greatly. What the viewer understood or remembered varied, but the presence of a common visual experience was part of the formation of a collective culture with a shared sensibility.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">

I deeply regret this news, and hope that you will find solace in knowing that he was a patriot who served his country to the ultimate level of sacrifice. He and his comrades held the Federal forces back at Fort Gregg. By keeping them out of the city the first night of battle, we were able to evacuate and save many lives, thanks to these brave men.</p><p>He was well loved by his fellow men and could be relied upon by any and all who served with him. We will feel his loss but will remember him for his unwavering loyalty to his regiment.</p><p>I am Sir your obedient servant, Robert Freeme, Lt. </p>

No more insipid dinner conversation or having my decisions made for me by Lucy’s ridiculous husband, a coward who sidestepped the war by paying $300 for an exemption while pretending to have bad legs. Imagine Father’s money being used for cowardice! I see them growing poorer and I am determined to leave Concord. So I am headed to Seattle! A few girls have already gone and I will join the second journey. There I am promised a paying job as a teacher, a family who will host me, and the prospect of marriage. There are many men in Washington and far fewer in Concord. Whatever happens, I am ready for adventure and to become a real pioneer!</p>

Without waiting for me to speak, he spoke to me without removing his hat. Well, there are those among us who will continue the fight in our own way. I have joined with my neighbors in the secret Klan and tonight we will make sure that Henry remembers that we are not of equal station. All these fellows need is a little reminder of power and maybe they will go somewhere else to build their own mills and stores. My daughters plague me about trying to find a husband wearing their old and worn dresses, while our own freed slaves can afford corsets and shoes and even lace.</p>

          <p>Now that the war is over I am still haunted in my nightmares by our darkest day. At Chancellorsville, we were to blame for the volley of shots that killed our beloved General Stonewall Jackson. General Lee mourned grievously. The next day in battle we lost more of us than any other regiment. The world will always remember that we killed our General. After the battle, I was glad to be among the wounded. My arm, sorely infected, was cut off in the field hospital. Small punishment to ease my grief at the loss of Jackson. It is my daily reminder of shame. Now home, I saw Rosemary, my fiancée, but I shook with anxiety. How can I marry when I cannot do the most basic tasks? She held my face with those delicate hands, now scarred by work, and answered me without saying a word. I don’t deserve her! But our whole town is rejoicing and my elderly father said the future is finally real again.</p>

  <div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Few events have loomed larger in the history of the war or our nation’s memory than the three-day battle of Gettysburg in southern Pennsylvania in July 1863. But how has that turning point been remembered? We have Lincoln’s words, Brady’s photographs, and as was common practice, maps drawn <i>after </i>the battle. These maps of Gettysburg were drawn under the auspices of an increasingly powerful Federal government, and subject to a pervasive call for common standards.</p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Matthew Brady is recognized as the father of photojournalism because of his initiatives in documenting the Civil War through photography, a technology which was still in its infancy. His photographs, as well as those of other early photographers, provided the general public with its most graphic impression of the Gettysburg battle. Because of limited technology, none of these photographs were taken during the actual battle. <br> <br>Brady and his team did not arrive in the Gettysburg area until two weeks after the battle. Since the bodies had been removed, they photographed prominent landmarks. One of these images included a shot of Little and Big Round Top, two rocky hills where Confederate troops made an unsuccessful assault on the Union left flank on the second day of the battle.</p>

</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>This bird’s-eye view of Gettysburg was one of the first and most attractive cartographic representations published after the battle. Despite its rapid production within less than a year after the engagement, its compilation was based on substantial research and provided a reportedly accurate portrayal of the military action and battleground. John Bachelder, a military instructor, historian, and artist before the war, was responsible for its compilation and publication. As hostilities began, he decided to follow the war in order to document its one decisive battle. He arrived at Gettysburg as the dead still lay on the ground. He spent 84 days traversing the battlefield, sketching its topography and interviewing convalescing Confederate soldiers, Union officers, and local residents in order to gather information for his meticulously-researched view.</p>

  <p>After the war, John Bachelder, who prepared the dramatic bird’s-eye view of Gettysburg and assisted with the preparation of the official after-battle maps, resided in Boston’s Hyde Park suburb. He devoted the remainder of his life preparing the written and illustrated history of this one battle. These efforts included a painting of Longstreet’s assault, a battlefield guidebook, a 2,500 page manuscript history of the battle, and serving as director of the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association. For his services in the historical delineation of the battle, the citizens of Gettysburg presented him a scale model of a cannon made of shot and shells collected from the battlefield. The cannon is now maintained by the Hyde Park Historical Society. </p>

  <p>Following European military tradition, U.S. Army Engineers published maps for most major battles shortly after the war. However, the Gettysburg after-battle maps were not published until 1876. In comparison to the others, they are quite remarkable. Their production resulted from the collaboration of a civilian, John Bachelder, and a team of Army surveyors under the direction of noted mapmaker, Gen. G. K. Warren. These topographic surveys were so detailed that the resulting maps, issued at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000 feet, used four-foot contours and shading to represent the terrain. Three maps, rather than one, documented the positions and movements of the armies during the course of the battle.<br></p>

<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>Representative of a typical after-battle plan, this small map was prepared by Charles Reed, a participant in the conflict. Published the year after the battle, it suggests the relative positions of Union forces in black and Rebel forces in red, primarily on the second and third days of the encounter. Topography is crudely represented by hachures, with only major roads delineated. Born and educated in Charlestown, Massachusetts, Reed enlisted in the 9th Massachusetts Battery as a bugler. Before the war, he worked independently as an illustrator and lithographer. During the war, he recorded his observations in sketch books and embellished letters to his parents, now preserved in the Library of Congress. Following the war, his illustrations appeared in The Boston Globe and several Civil War-related publications. </p>

In this exhibition, we pay special attention to a number of Boston heroes, including three Massachusetts regiments especially as they are remembered on the Boston Common and in the Boston Public Library.</p>

  <p>A great bronze statue, located on the south side of the Public Garden, honors Charles Sumner, U.S. Senator, orator, and staunch abolitionist. This memorial, created by the noted sculptor Thomas Ball, stands nine feet tall and sits on a twelve-foot tall square granite pedestal. Bearing no inscription except the subject’s last name, it was unveiled on December 23, 1878, to an audience of 300 with very little formality. Born and educated in Boston, Sumner entered the U.S. Senate as a Free Soil candidate, later becoming a Radical Republican. He spoke harshly against the institution of slavery, including a stern speech titled “The Crime against Kansas“ directed toward the authors of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.</p>

The statue was relocated to Dorchester in 1911. Everett, pictured here in an undated portrait, was an anti-slavery advocate, but as a member of the Whig party, worked tirelessly to protect the already unstable Union. It was not until the creation of the Confederacy and the attack on Fort Sumter, that Everett’s attempts to compromise ceased. On November 19, 1863, in front of a captivated audience, Everett delivered his two-hour oration at the dedication of Gettysburg's National Cemetery. However, his speech was eclipsed by Abraham Lincoln’s three-minute “address.“ </p>

  <p>This modern reconstruction presents a comprehensive depiction of documented routes, stations, and destinations on the Underground Railroad. It is apparent that there were many journeys generally in a south to north direction, both by land and sea. Although the routes traversed all the states north of the Ohio River and the Mason-Dixon Line, there was a heavy concentration in the Mid-Atlantic and New England states. By closely examining both of these maps, it is evident that there were a number of “stations“ in the Boston area, including such recorded stations as the William Jackson House in Newton, the William Lloyd Garrison House in Roxbury, the William Ingersoll Bowditch House in Brookline, and the Lewis and Harriet Hayden House on Boston's Beacon Hill. </p>

As depicted in a contemporary print, the completed monument is composed of a single column topped with a copper figure representing the “Genius of America,“ reaching a height of 72 feet. At its base stand four statues of classically dressed women symbolizing North, South, East, and West. Below them are four additional figures that depict the Army, Navy, History, and Peace.

  <p><i><b>Memorial to Robert Gould Shaw, by Augustus St. Gaudens</b><br></i><b>[Boston, ca. 1897]</b><br><b>Fine Arts Dept.</b></p>
</div>
<div class="st__content-block st__content-block--text">
  <p>During the last decade of the 19th century, several more important sculptures were added to the city’s growing list of Civil War monuments. One, known as the Shaw Memorial, was unveiled May 31, 1897, on the Boston Common facing the State House. It was designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, the nation’s premier sculptor. It immortalizes the brave soldiers of the all black Massachusetts 54th Volunteer Infantry and their colonel, Robert Gould Shaw, who gained recognition for their ill-fated attack on Fort Wagner near Charleston, South Carolina, July 18, 1863. This bronze relief is eleven feet tall and fourteen feet wide; it depicts three rows, increasing in depth, of fully equipped soldiers marching off to battle, and in the foreground is an impressive equestrian statue of Colonel Shaw.</p>

  <p>Another memorial erected in the 1890s consists of twin lions mounted on either side of the grand stair case at the new Boston Public Library in Copley Square, which opened to the public in February 1895. These sculptures were designed by Augustus Saint-Gaudens’ brother, Louis. The two large reclining lions were carved from solid blocks of unpolished Sienna marble. One sculpture is dedicated to the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry and the other honors the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, also known as the Harvard Regiment. Directly below the lions’ paws, there is a list of the battles and campaigns in which each regiment took part. </p>
